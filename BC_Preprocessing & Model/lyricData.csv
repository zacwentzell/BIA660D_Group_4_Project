money had me sleepin from hall to hall Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin 30 shows a month and I still wont buy me no Lexus What is an advisor Somebody thats holdin my checks Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt I read a case about Rihannas accountant and wondered How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers The type of shitll make me flip out and just kill somethin Drill somethin get ill and fill ratchets with a lil somethin I practiced runnin from fear guess I had some good luck At 27 years old my biggest fear was bein judged How they look at me reflect on myself my family my city What they see from me would trickle down generations in time What they hear from me would make em highlight my simplest lines Im talkin fear fear of losin creativity Im talkin fear fear of missin out on you and me Im talkin fear fear of losin loyalty from pride Cause my DNA wont let me involve in the light of God Im talkin fear fear that my humbleness is gone Im talkin fear fear that love aint livin here no more Im talkin fear fear that its wickedness or weakness Fear whatever it is both is distinctive Fear what happens on Earth stays on Earth And

Macklemore & Ryan Lewis Featuring Mary Lambert,Rap,Piano   Macklemore When I was in the third grade I thought that I was gay Û÷Cause I could draw my uncle was and I kept my room straight I told my mom tears rushing down my face She\s like Ben you\ve loved girls since before Pre-K! Trippin\ yeah I guess she had a point didn\t she A bunch of stereotypes all in my head I remember doing the math like Yeah I\m good at little league. A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant For those that like the same sex had the characteristics The right-wing conservatives think its a decision And you can be cured with some treatment and religion Man-made rewiring of a pre-disposition Playing God aw nah here we go America the brave still fears what we dont know And God loves all his children is somehow forgotten But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago I dont know  Mary Lambert And I cant change even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I cant change even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love my love my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me Have you read the YouTube comments lately Man that\s gay gets dropped on the daily Weve become so numb to what were sayin Our culture founded from oppression Yet we dont have acceptance for em Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board A word rooted in hate yet our genre still ignores it Gay is synonymous with the lesser Its the same hate thats caused wars from religion Gender to skin color the complexion of your pigment The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins Its human rights for everybody there is no difference Live on and be yourself When I was in church they taught me something else If you preach hate at the service those words arent anointed That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen I might not be the same but thats not important No freedom til were equal damn right I support it Trombone Interlude  Mary Lambert And I cant change even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I cant change even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love my love my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm We press play dont press pause progress march on! With a veil over our eyes we turn our back on the cause Til the day that my uncles can be united by law Kids are walking round the hallway Plagued by a pain in their heart A world so hateful some would rather die than be who they are And a certificate on paper isnt gonna solve it all But its a damn good place to start No laws gonna change us we have to change us Whatever god you believe in we come from the same one Strip away the fear underneath its all the same love About time that we raised up!  Mary Lambert And I cant change even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I cant change even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love my love my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm Love is patient love is kind Love is patient not crying on Sundays Love is kind not crying on Sundays Love is patient not crying on Sundays Love is kind not crying on Sundays Love is patient not crying on Sundays Love is kind not crying on Sundays Love is patient not crying on Sundays Love is kind not crying on Sundays Love is patient not crying on Sundays Love is kind not crying on Sundays,Same Love,,

The Alliance Featuring Fabo,Rap,Dans le systÌ¬me du Rap FranÌ¤ais une nouvelle rivalitÌ© est reprÌ©sentÌ©e par deux groupes distincts mais dÛªÌ©gale importance  ces 2 camps sont eux-mÌ»mes reprÌ©sentÌ©s par White qui enquÌ»te pour le 92i et Louis jeune recrue chez Back To The Futur.Voici leurs histoires.  Une chronique et des personnages inspirÌ©s par des faits rÌ©els.  Tin Tin ! JÛªvivais de viols et dÛªpetites copines de vols et dÛªpetites combines de mix-tapes et dÛªpetites compiles. Ce matin lÌÊ je reÌ¤ois un SMS dÛªun numÌ©ro inconnu +336Û_. Rejoins nous au plus vite dans la foret de Meudon. CÛªÌ©tait Chris Macari JÛªcrois que je nÛªÌ©tais pas entrÌ© en contact avec le 92i depuis quÛªon avait Ì©tÌ© chargÌ© de tirer sur La Fouine dÌ©but 2013. bandes dessinÌ©es jÛªarrive devant cette vaste forÌ»t je gare mon vÌ©hicule puis jÛªle laisse ÌÊ lÛªabandon comme dans GTA. JÛªactive le code dÛªarmes en semant des petits bouts de pain sur mon chÛªmin genre le petit poucet. 1. Soit cette forÌ»t avait la mÌ»me superficie que le Congo Ok merciÛ_ Sinon Ì¤a cherche des Coconfort ou quoi  lol des baskets Quechuaã¢ ce genre connerie cÛªÌ©tait plus dÛªmon Ì¢ge YÛªavait Mazalaza qui gardait la porte de la cabane il portait une toge noir et une longue capuche recouvrait les 3/4 de son visage il me tint a peu prÌ¬s ce langage  Evandum esperanti spiritis. On Ì©tait nombreux sombres et anonymes... On aurait dit une regroupement dÛªfans de MylÌ¬ne Farmer. LÌÊ yÛªa un hologramme de Booba qui est apparu en plein milieu dÛªla piÌ¬ce tout lÛªmonde a posÌ© un genoux ÌÊ terre comme si cÛªÌ©tait Apophis. JÛªcomprenais plus rien jÛªcroyais quÛªil fallait Ì»tre Kryptonien pour faire ce genre de connerie. Booba ou plutÌ«t son hologramme portait un slip et de grandes chaÌ¨nes en or tombaient sur son corps huilÌ© il ressemblait grave ÌÊ XerxÌ¬s. Kaaris mÛªenvoie des piques depuis quelques temps dans ses freestyles sur SkryrÛ_ Cette derniÌ¬re phrase a foutu un bordel monstre tout lÛªmonde a levÌ© sa lance en lÛªair en hurlant comme les hommes des sables sur Tatooine. Donc en rÌ©sumÌ© il semblait que Booba nÛªavait plus le contrÌ«le du monstre quÛªil avait crÌ©Ì© un peu comme le Dr GÌ©ro avec les cyborgs n17 et 18 Ben 1 million par ci 1 million par lÌÊ ! JÛªai jurÌ© fidÌ©litÌ© comme ÌÊ la table ronde. Pour rÌ©ussir ma mission on mÛªa Ì©quipÌ© dÛªune tenue Unkutã¢ et de gadgets complÌ¬tement inutiles comme Jerry des Totally Spies. Je devais donc rÌ©unir une poignÌ©e dÛªhommes genre Samuel L. Jackson dans The Avengers Je connais pas la recette du succÌ¬s mais tant que je serai dans la cuisine tu boufferas tout ce que je prÌ©pare. il se prenait pour La Reine DÛªAngleterre. Donc avec Kaaris et Miky on y va on fait le truc cÛªest Chris Macari qui est derriÌ¬re la camÌ©ra et on fait les choses correctement.  Sauf que une semaine plus tard on voit ce que Ì¤a donne et on se rend compte que Chris Macari il a fait des dingueries  - Des passages dÛªabord de Rohff et ses frÌ¬res enfants jouant avec des pistolets NERF. - Puis de Rohff ÌÊ son procÌ¬s aprÌ¬s avoir braquÌ© son frÌ¬re. Ainsi que les tÌ©moignages de ce dernier. - Appelez moi le directeur ! La secrÌ©taire a rÌ©pondu  - TÛªas cru cÛªÌ©tait La MAAF ici ou quoi  AprÌ¬s il lÛªa Ì©tranglÌ©e jusquÛªÌÊ lÛªÌ©vanouissement et a traÌ¨nÌ© son corps comme dans Metal Gear Solid. On est parti ÌÊ Gare du Nord pour avoir plus dÛªinfos auprÌ¬s du dernier featuring connu de Booba un groupe de Boulogne qui se nomme SDHS. Salif LIM Zoxea CÛªest qui  CÛªest Mama ! CÛªest qui  CÛªest Mama ! La Puissance !! La Puissance !! nous ont encerclÌ©s comme dans un film de Bruce Lee. jÛªte lÛªrÌ©-pe-trai-pas. Ìàa parlait peu et nos ennemis avaient des coupes punk comme dans Ken Le Survivant jÛªadorais Ì¤a. ses gars ont mis une instru de Logobi GT la voix ÌÊ T-Pain Elle danse sexyyyy pooouuur toooi ! Je faisais du break Maxi le mec de Soul Blade. Ce bougzer de mauvais augure nous avait annoncÌ© une sale nouvelle. Sous le coup de la colÌ¬re Kaaris lui a rentrÌ© le mÌ»me chassÌ© que dans 300 en criant  This is Sparta ! Et le gars est tombÌ© dans les rails du RER D.  DÌ©pitÌ© je me disais que dÌ©jÌÊ Le NÌ©gro dans 300 il Ì©tait bÌ»te parce quÛªil se met dos ÌÊ un puits sans fond avant dÛªannoncer une mauvaise nouvelle.. Je mÛªen bats les couilles. Ao Kiji. OrlÌ©ans dans lÛªbut de rÌ©cupÌ©rer Dosseh un membre de la SDHS avec un pull Baby Miloã¢ est venu me voir tout essoufflÌ©. YÛªen a un il lÌ¢chait que des Tu reconnais ou tu nies  Avant chaque Ì©crasement dÛªtÌ»te. Louis Baltimore. - Non... Le linge est ÌÊ sortir du seau - Ah non ! LES SINGES VIENNENT DE SORTIR DU ZOO ! A ce moment lÌÊ jÛªai lÌ¢chÌ© un Ksoooo comme dans les mangas en V.O crÌ»te de PtÌ©rodactyle. N.I.R.O mais quand on mÛªa dit quÛªil faisait des projets avec des noms curieux comme ParaplÌ©gique ou RÌ©Ì©ducation le verrouiller avec une arme et de presser la flÌ¬che du haut comme CJ dans San Andreas. - Ah cÛªest pas grave  de toute faÌ¤on je ne tiens pas 1min30 contre Booba. Pour revenir aux montages Instagram Booba il faisait des trucs dÛªenfant  il a mis une perruque sur une photo de Kaaris et lui a dessinÌ© du maquillage avec du rouge ÌÊ lÌ¬vres en lÛªappelant Tata Clarisse. On aurait dit quand Rim-K a fait son couplet dans Pour Ceux. Encore aprÌ¬s on a pris des photos avec les gars du 93 en mode cÛªest notre team mais on ne connaissait quÛªun seul mec dedans. Ce mec cÛªÌ©tait Noah Lunsi un mec des Rougemonts avec des tatouages tout droit sortis de Crying Freeman. Il nous a proposÌ© de recruter Dims Therapy anciennement Dims 92i.  Dims Therapy cÛªÌ©tait un ancien supporter du 92i mais il a eu des problÌ¬mes avec les gars ÌÊ Booba on sait pas trop ce qui sÛªest passÌ© mais il sÛªest fait vanner sale cÛªÌ©tait trop sale mÌ»me.  Ils ont tellement Ì©tÌ© malpropres avec lui que Dims a dÌ©cidÌ© de suivre son propre Nindo celui de Therapy 2093. Nous on est allÌ©s devant chez lui en Ì©coutant IÛªm so Hood de 50. Et lÌÊ on entend distinctement la voix de Dims qui disait Ì»tre armÌ© dÛªun fusil ÌÊ lunette et venir dÛªune Ì¨le peuplÌ©e de snipers. Ce mec mentait comme Pippo dans One Piece cÛªÌ©tait Ì©cÒurant. - Ecoute Dims Booba demande ÌÊ ses gens de courir comme des esclaves.. Nous on veut que tu marches comme un roi. On a assiÌ©gÌ© lÛªendroit comme LÛªEmpire Perse. - NE ME MENTIONNE PAS DANS TES MENSONGES RENOI ! Miky lÛªa endormi avec du chloroforme et un mouchoir comme dans Tintin parce quÛªil semblait nerveux. Moi personnellement jÛªÌ©tais pour lÛªanesthÌ©sier avec une seringue ÌÊ la Dexter - Renoi tÛªes un bon mais tu balances et aprÌ¬s tu pleures shrab Jesse Pinkman. - Merci SwaggMan mais je me passerai de tes commentaires. Et Miky nous a montrÌ© un tweet de Mac Tyer nous apportant son soutien dans notre campagne. dans un style purement AlqaÌødesque mon Ì©quipe lui ouvre la chatte jusquÛªau menton ! Ìàa sentait lÛªsapin pour Chris... - Laisse tomber Morray cÛªest la guerre !!! jÛªannonÌ¤ais le plan dÛªattaque comme le GÌ©nÌ©ral Crassus. - Si jÛªtraine en bas dÛªchez toi jÛªfais chuter lÛªprix dÛªlimmobilier. une grosse balayette de PremiÌ¬re League Nous Ì©tions 5 vs 7 alors tout dÛªsuite jÛªai suggÌ©rÌ© quÛªon sÛªbatte dans le couloir Ì©troit du hall cela permettait de limiter le nombre dÛªennemis ÌÊ chaque attaque comme lÛªavait pensÌ© Leonidas dans la bataille des Thermopyles. Booba a fait le mÌ»me genre de vrille que dans Tigres et Dragons avant de sÛªexploser contre une boÌ¨te aux lettres cÛªÌ©tait grave expÌ©ditif. - La muertÌ© me va si bien En projetant Fababy front en avant comme un casse-bÌ©lier il allait lui transpercer lÛªcorps comme Sangoku enfant contre le dÌ©mon Piccolo. Sultan sÛªest Ì©criÌ©  - POUSSEZ VOUS ! En sprintant dans la direction de Gradur. Tout lÛªmonde sÛªest Ì©cartÌ©  dÛªun coup il sÛªest jetÌ© sur le dos il a glissÌ© sur plusieurs mÌ¬tres puis il a positionnÌ© ses deux pieds pour recevoir Fababy... - Non ne me dites pas que... CÛªest la catapulte infernale des frÌ¬res Derrick !!!!! A criÌ© Dosseh. Il a saisi le visage de Fababy dans une main et celui de Sultan dans lÛªautre comme Venom. LÌÊ il les a soulevÌ© puis il a sprintÌ© en frottant leurs crÌ¢nes contre les murs... on aurait grave dit une pub pour du gel Vivelle Dopã¢. les cheveux de Fababy se sont deshÌ©rissÌ©s comme ceux dÛªun Super Sayian. Gradur respirait fort comme le Minotaure... il Ì©tait assiÌ©gÌ© comme la Gaule. ÌälÌ©mentaire mon Cher Watson on ne raconte pas ce quÛªon fait ni ÌÊ nos putes ni sur Twitter VexÌ© je lui ai dit que jÛªavais pas de rÌ©flexion ÌÊ me manger de la part dÛªun mec qui sÛªest tatouÌ© un aigle sur la joue.  Il a calmement rÌ©pondu que cÛªÌ©tait une colombe LÛªobjet a fait plus de rebonds quÛªune passe de Matuidi avant dÛªexploser. Dims a criÌ©  - Vous jouez ÌÊ quoi avec vos sabres les mecs  Vous allez vous blesser !! ÌÏnkut de Chatelet car il Ì©tait vendeur lÌÊ bas. Bretteurs LÛªArgent cÛªest bien le respect cÛªest mieux Gros.  CÛªÌ©tait Kennedy. Kennedy a sorti un marteau gÌ©ant de son sac Reebok tandis que jÛªÌ©tais en pleine course vers lui jÛªallais me faire assommer comme dans Niky Larson. - Je suis une balance normal que je pÌ¬se plus que toi Gradur directement dans le 59... Enfin si Gradur ne possÌ©dait pas de cette technique Sheguey 1 puis Sheguey 2 puis Sheguey3... merde ce mec est quand mÌ»me allÌ© jusquÛªÌÊ 6 Sheguey... On espÌ©rait le meilleur mais on sÛªattendait au pire. Et il a envoyÌ© tous les CDs dÛªun coup comme des shurikens. Je me suis mis ÌÊ couvert aussi vite que dans Time Crisis. Il a Ì©tÌ© traversÌ© comme Freezer quand il a reÌ¤u son propre kienzan. Dans son agonie il a avouÌ© que Booba ne connaissait pas le code de La Rue que Les Bonhommes se parlent en face et il a terminÌ© par  - Alors MC va te faire niquer toi et tes clashs Gros. une petite canette de Miranda. En revanche Kaaris se tenait dans un coin de la piÌ¬ce... les bras croisÌ©s fiÌ¬re allure genre VÌ©gÌ©ta. On aurait dit que jÛªavais frappÌ© sur du fer il a rien senti et il a dit sans changer dÛªexpression du visage  - Comment Ì¤a Ah Lannister  CÛªest ta daronne la Lannister ouais ! sa canette de Mirinda Attendez calmement quand lÛªennemi est fÌ©brile soyez repus quand lÛª ennemi crie famine. Lei-Wulong  lÛªart de la guerre. - Bon dÌ©jÌÊ cÛªest pas Lei-Wulong cÛªest Sun-Tzu. - Mais non  - Ben si - Bah cÛªest qui Lei Wulong alors  - Rien ÌÊ voir cÛªest un personnage dans Tekkenã¢. - Ahh mÌ»me il ressemble ÌÊ la mort ÌÊ Jacky-Chan lÌÊ  - LÛªange de la mort dans la peau dans la peau. - Grand mÌ¬re sait faire un bon mafÌ© jÛªlai sur le torse gros ! - CÛªest ta grand mÌ¬re qui tÛªa dit quÛªtallais y arriver  CÛªest qui cÛªest Madame Soleil  Ou celle oÌ_ je tÛªai tirÌ© dÛªune fusillade  une paire de Nike Cortezã¢ Let the music play de Barry Blanc. Il a plongÌ© comme Ian Thorpe puis il a atterri en roulade dans lÛªherbe avant de dÌ©taler. En zigzaguant entre les vÌ©hicules ÌÊ pleine vitesse comme dans Le Flic de ShangaÌø. S.e.v.r.a.n. 50 dÛªun cÌ«tÌ© 50 de lÛªautre Ì¤a allait sÛªenculer comme dans Crows ZÌ©ro. Fred Musa il avait rappliquÌ© avec un arc et des flÌ¬ches. - Quoi ils lÛªont jetÌ© du toit  - Mais ouais DossÛª ! Ìàa lÛªa poussÌ© Il sÛªest accrochÌ© au bord avec une main et yÛªa un mec qui a Ì©crasÌ© ses doigts pour quÛªil lÌ¢che ! - Comme Mufasa genre  - Mufa.. qui  - Mufassa ouesh le daron de SimbÛ_ ARRRGH ON Y VAAAAAAA cÛªÌ©tait barbare comme dans Braveheart. JÛªÌ©tais comme John McLane dans Die Hard 3 Une JournÌ©e en Enfer.. CÛªÌ©tait une sale journÌ©e. Ìàa criait comme les fans de Rohff quand ils se sont mangÌ©s un plan ÌÊ Urban Peace... On aurait dit la bataille finale dans Le Seigneur des anneaux. Ìàa allait sÛªenculer mÌ©chamment faÌ¤on Kick-Ass 2. Wallah Therapy il Ì©tait venu avec un bandeau de pirate sur lÛªÒil droit ÌÊ cause dÛªune conjonctivite mais on aurait grave dit Le Gouverneur. + Sindy de la Team BS qui se vantait dÛªavoir trop dÛªadversaires. + Les TragÌ©die + Tonton Marcel + Bizon qui venait de sortir de prison. + Dixon de la Banlieue Sale qui avait un compte ÌÊ rÌ©gler. + Brahim Tavarez le clone bienveillant je prÌ©cise Bienveillant car cÛªÌ©tait Booba lÛªoriginal malveillant... - CÛªest normal quÛªil y ait un drapeau de LÛªAlgÌ©rie qui flotte au milieu de ce bordel  Booba dÌ©jÌÊ il avait presque 40 ans et il se comportait comme un geek. Lui aussi il avait cherchÌ© la merde en envoyant des mÌ©taphores oÌ_ Ì¤a parle de Soleil assez haut et de TÌ»te du Roi pour clasher Booba en subli. Mastermind le nouvel album de Rick Ross. DÌ©sormais ÌÊ la place du bras droit Booba avait un canon sciÌ© cÛªÌ©tait Ì©poustouflant. Il a criÌ©  -Je te tire dessus comme Cobra Brraaa ! Je danse plus la Hype. Le savoir est une arme je suis calibrÌ© donc je suis pas teubÌ©. Kaaris avait survÌ©cu ÌÊ sa chute cÛªÌ©tait un de ces nÌ¬gres qui persistent jusquÛªÌÊ ce que les tÌ©nÌ¬bres sÛªÌ©claircissent. Glenn Smith qui voyait le passage de La Banlieue Sale au 92i comme une promotion dans sa carriÌ¬re. Fin du clash comme Jay-Z et Nas.,Tattoo,,

"Ja Rule Featuring Charli ""Chuck"" Baltimore",Rap,lyrics by rapper Jean Grae -Jean Grae ÛÏDonÛªt Rush MeÛ -Joan Morgan When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost A Hip-Hop Feminist Breaks it Down epigraphs graffiti artists deejays emcees Hip-hop as a culture originally included graffiti writing deejaying break dancing rap music and the oft-forgotten fifth element knowledge. Hip-hop feminists are women and men who step up and speak out against gender exploitation in hip-hop. Shorty they want to find ways to move beyond counting the amount of times a particular rapper says the word ÛÏbitchÛ or ÛÏhoÛ to a focus on what they consider to be larger issues and concerns. For example they also want to begin to complicate understandings of womenÛªs complicity in the objectification of women especially as it pertains to video-hoes. Black men rapped surrounded by dozens of black and Latina women dressed in bathing suits or scantily clad in some other fashion. who wanted to initiate a dialogue with Nelly after viewing his derogatory video 85 ÛÏTip DrillÛ one part Jigga a pinch of a global awareness for good measure ÛÏP.S.Û the last verse I critiqued the image of the ride-or-die chick as it is represented in hip-hop the girl willing to do whatever she can for her man a girl that the lyrics of Ja RuleÛªs ÛÏDown Ass ChickÛ call to mind The point is also to complicate our thinking about hip-hop in ways that stop us from creating dichotomies that place rappers like Ja Rule in one category labeled commercial negative and therefore bad and rappers like Dead Prez and others in another pile labeled conscious underground revolutionary and therefore good.

Low Life Organization,Rap,Is ``tires one syllable or two Lets set the existence-of-god issue aside for a later volume and just stipulate that in some way self-replicating organisms came into existence on this planet and immediately began trying to get rid of each other either by spamming their environments with rough copies of themselves or by more direct means which hardly need to be belabored. Most of them failed and their genetic legacy was erased from the universe forever but a few found some way to survive and to propagate. After about three billion years of this sometimes zany frequently tedious fugue of carnality and carnage Godfrey Waterhouse IV was born in Murdo South Dakota to Blanche the wife of a Congregational preacher named Bunyan Waterhouse. Like every other creature on the face of the earth Godfrey was by birthright a stupendous badass albeit in the somewhat narrow technical sense that he could trace his ancestry back up a long line of slightly less highly evolved stupendous badasses to that first self-replicating gizmo--which given the number and variety of its descendants might justifiably be described as the most stupendous badass of all time. Everyone and everything that wasnt a stupendous badass was dead.,Mind Throbbin,,

JAY-Z,Rap,Students at a Southaven Miss. middle school were educated in the ÛÏBig PimpinÛªÛ thug life of Jay-Z and the school district canÛªt imagine why anyone would object to lessons on reading writing and rapping. one of the most successful hip-hop artists and entrepreneurs in the nation. They were also tested on their knowledge about Jay-ZÛªs ÛÏresilience.Û A parent asked to remain anonymous over fears of repercussions . I was able to verify her claims and have agreed to provide anonymity. Û÷Big PimpinÛª ÛÏAnother song talked about thug life. My child was getting an education about thug life.Û She could not believe that her child was learning about a man who sings songs that degrade women and glorify the thug life. The spokesperson told me she could not understand why Fox News was interested in a simple classroom assignment. they got the brush-off. ÛÏThey made it sound like it was no big dealÛ the mom told me. ÛÏThey said the point of the assignment was because Jay-Z is successful.Û rapper owns a professional sports team. not thug life things.Û Using the schoolÛªs logic the mom wondered why the school doesnÛªt assign lessons on Hugh Hefner or Larry Flynt. ÛÏWe are conservativeÛ she said. ÛÏWe are Christian. And this was brought into my house. ThatÛªs why I was so furious. It was a moral issue.Û The facts are this page represented this thug in a positive way and calls him successful. Success to me doesnÛªt mean demeaning women glorifying drugs and violence and flaunting money. Success should be about living decent and having respect for themselves and others. And to put an exclamation point on his reasoning the dad included the lyrics to a Jay-Z song IÛªd love to share some of those lyrics with you ÛÒ but IÛªve got standards. Jay-Z has an affinity for the F-word and the B-word. Heather Fox is not surprised to learn about the three-day Jay-Z lecture at the middle school.

Disturbed,Rock,Ive come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night and touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never shared And no one dared disturb the sound of silence Fools said I You do not know Silence like a cancer grows Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you But my words like silent raindrops fell And echoed in the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed To the neon God they made And the sign flashed out its warning In the words that it was forming And the sign said The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls And tenement halls,The Sound Of Silence,,

Arctic Monkeys,Rock,Have you got colour in your cheeks Do you ever get the fear that you cant shift the type That sticks around like summat in your teeth Are there some aces up your sleeve Have you no idea that youre in deep Ive dreamt about you nearly every night this week How many secrets can you keep Cause theres this tune I found That makes me think of you somehow And I play it on repeat Until I fall asleep Spilling drinks on my settee Do I wanna know If this feeling flows both ways Sad to see you go Was sorta hoping that youâd stay Baby we both know That the nights were mainly made For saying things that you canât say tomorrow day Crawling back to you Ever thought of calling when youve had a few Cause I always do Maybe Im too busy being yours to fall for somebody new Now Ive thought it through Crawling back to you So have you got the guts Been wondering if your hearts still open And if so I wanna know what time it shuts Simmer down and pucker up Im sorry to interrupt its just Im constantly on the cusp Of trying to kiss you I dont know if you feel the same as I do We could be together if you wanted to Do I wanna know If this feeling flows both ways Sad to see you go Was sorta hoping that youâd stay Baby we both know That the nights were mainly made For saying things that you canât say tomorrow day Crawling back to you Ever thought of calling when youve had a few Cause I always do Maybe Im too busy being yours to fall for somebody new Now Ive thought it through Crawling back to you Do I wanna know If this feeling flows both ways Sad to see you go Was sorta hoping that youâd stay Baby we both know That the nights were mainly made For saying things that you canât say tomorrow day Do you want me crawling back to you,Do I Wanna Know?,,

Ed Sheeran,Rock,Oh misty eye of the mountain below Keep careful watch of my brothers souls And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke Keep watching over Durins sons If this is to end in fire then we should all burn together Watch the flames climb high into the night Calling out father oh stand by and we will Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side And if we should die tonight we should all die together Raise a glass of wine for the last time Calling out father oh Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side Desolation comes upon the sky Now I see fire inside the mountain I see fire burning the trees And I see fire hollowing souls I see fire blood in the breeze And I hope that you remember me Oh should my people fall then surely Ill do the same Confined in mountain halls we got too close to the flame Calling out father oh hold fast and we will Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side Desolation comes upon the sky Now I see fire inside the mountain I see fire burning the trees And I see fire hollowing souls I see fire blood in the breeze And I hope that you remember me And if the night is burning I will cover my eyes For if the dark returns then my brothers will die And as the skys falling down it crashed into this lonely town And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out Now I see fire inside the mountain I see fire burning the trees I see fire hollowing souls I see fire blood in the breeze I see fire oh you know I saw a city burning out I see fire feel the heat upon my skin I see fire And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside,I See Fire,,

Pearl Jam,Rock, Hear the sirens hear the sirens   Hear the sirens hear the circus so profound I hear the sirens more and more in this here town Oh had to take your hand and feel your breath For fear this someday will be over I pull you close so much to lose Knowing that nothing lasts forever I didnât care before you were here I danced in laughter with the ever after But all things change let this remain Hear the sirens covering distance in the night The sound echoing closer will they come for me next time For every choice mistake I made its not my plan To see you in the arms of another man And if you choose to stay Iâll wait Iâll understand Want you to know that should I go I always loved you held you high above too I studied your face the fear goes away,Sirens,,

Lorde,Rock,Produced by Joel Little Theres a humming in the restless summer air And were slipping off the course that we prepared But in all chaos there is calculation Dropping glasses just to hear them break Youve been drinking like the world was gonna end it didnt Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend go figure Its clear that someones gotta go We mean it but I promise were not mean And the cry goes out oh! They lose their minds for us And how it plays out oh! Now were in the ring And were coming for blood You could try and take us But were the gladiators Everyone a rager But secretly theyre saviors Glory and gore go hand in hand Thats why were making headlines You could try and take us But victorys contagious Delicate in every way but one the swordplay God knows we like archaic kinds of fun the old way Chance is the only game I play with baby We let our battles choose us And the cry goes out oh! They lose their minds for us And how it plays out oh! Now were in the ring And were coming for blood You could try and take us But were the gladiators Everyone a rager But secretly theyre saviors Glory and gore go hand in hand Thats why were making headlines You could try and take us But victorys contagious No-one round heres good at keeping their eyes closed The suns starting to light up when were walking home Tired little laughs gold lie promises well always win at this I dont ever think about death Its alright if you do its fine We gladiate but I guess were really fighting ourselves Roughing up our minds so were ready when the kill time comes Wide awake in bed words in my brain Secretly you love this Do you even wanna go free Let me in the ring Ill show you what that big word means You could try and take us But were the gladiators Everyone a rager But secretly theyre saviors Glory and gore go hand in hand Thats why were making headlines You could try and take us But victorys contagious,Glory And Gore,,

Of Monsters And Men,Rock,Jumping up and down the floor My head is an animal And once there was an animal It had a son that mowed the lawn The dragonfly it ran away But it came back with a story to say Her dirty paws and furry coat She ran down the forest slope The forest of talking trees They used to sing about the birds and the bees The bees had declared a war The sky wasnt big enough for them all The birds they got help from below From dirty paws and the creatures of snow And for a while things were cold They were scared down in their holes The forest that once was green Was colored black by those killing machines But she and her furry friends Took down the queen bee and her men And thats how the story goes The story of those beast with those four dirty paws,Dirty Paws,,

Rise Against,Rock,I can still remember The words and what they meant As we etched them with our fingers In years of wet cement The days blurred into each other Though everything seemed clear We cruised along at half speed But then we shifted gears We ran like vampires from a thousand burning suns But even then we should have stayed But we ran away Now all my friends are gone Maybe weve outgrown all the things that we once loved Runaway But what are we running from A show of hands from those in this audience of one Where have they gone Identities assume us As nine and five add up Synchronizing watches To the seconds that we lost I looked up and saw you I know that you saw me We froze but for a moment In empathy I brought down the sky for you but all you did was shrug You gave my emptiness a name But you ran away Now all my friends are gone Maybe weve outgrown all the things that we once loved Runaway But what are we running from A show of hands from those in this audience of one Where have they gone Were all okay until the day were not The surface shines while the inside rots We raced the sunset and we almost won We slammed the brakes but the wheels went on,Audience Of One,,
Dave Matthews Band,Rock,Lying in the park on a beautiful day Sun shine on the grass and the children play Sirenâs passing fire engines red Someoneâs house is burning down on a day like this The evening comes and weâre hanging out On the front step and a car rolls by with the windows rolled down And that War song is playing âWhy Canât We Be Friendsâ Someone is screaming and crying in the apartment upstairs Funny the way it is and if you think about it Somebodyâs going hungry and someone else is eating out Funny the way it is not right or wrong Somebodyâs heart is broken and it becomes your favorite song The way your mouth feels in a lovers kiss Like a pretty bird on a breeze or water to a fish A bomb blast brings the building crashing to the floor Hear the laughter while the children play war Funny the way it is and if you think about it One kid walks ten miles to school anotherâs dropping out Funny the way it is not right or wrong On a soldierâs last breath his babyâs being born Standing on the bridge watch the water passing under me It mustâve been much harder when there was no bridge just water Now the world is small remember how it used to be With mountains and oceans and winters and rivers and stars Watch the sky in a jet plane so far out of my reach Is there someone up there looking down on me Boy chase a bird so close but every time Heâll never catch her but he canât stop trying Somebodyâs broken heart becomes your favorite song It mustâve been much harder when there was no bridge just water Now the world is small compared to how it used to be With mountains and oceans and winters and rivers and stars,Funny The Way It Is,,

Bob Dylan,country, The pale moon rose in its glory Out oer the Western town She told a sad sad story Of the great ship that went down   Twas the fourteenth day of April Over the waves she rode Sailing into tomorrow To a gilded age foretold   The night was black with starlight The seas were sharp and clear Moving through the shadows The promised hour was near  Verse 4 Lights were holding steady Gliding over the foam All the lords and ladies Heading for their eternal home  Verse 5 The chandeliers were swaying From the balustrades above The orchestra was playing Songs of faded love  Verse 6 The watchman he lay dreaming As the ballroom dancers twirled He dreamed the Titanic was sinking Into the underworld  Verse 7 Leo took his sketchbook He was often so inclined He closed his eyes and painted The scenery in his mind  Verse 8 Cupid struck his bosom And broke it with a snap The closest woman to him He fell into her lap  Verse 9 He heard a loud commotion Something sounded wrong His inner spirit was saying That he couldnt stand here long  0 He staggered to the quarterdeck No time now to sleep Water on the quarterdeck Already three foot deep  1 Smokestack was leaning sideways Heavy feet began to pound He walked into the whirlwind Sky splitting all around  2 The ship was going under The universe had opened wide The roll was called up yonder The angels turned aside  3 Lights down in the hallway Flickering dim and dull Dead bodies already floating In the double bottom hull  4 The engines then exploded Propellers they failed to start The boilers overloaded The ships bow split apart  5 Passengers were flying Backward forward far and fast They mumbled fumbled and tumbled Each one more weary than the last  6 The veil was torn asunder Tween the hours of twelve and one No change no sudden wonder Could undo what had been done  7 The watchman lay there dreaming At forty-five degrees He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking Dropping to her knees  8 Wellington he was sleeping His bed began to slide His valiant heart was beating He pushed the tables aside  9 Glass of shattered crystal Lay scattered roundabout He strapped on both his pistols How long could he hold out  0 His men and his companions Were nowhere to be seen In silence there he waited for Time and space to intervene  1 The passageway was narrow There was blackness in the air He saw every kind of sorrow Heard voices everywhere  2 Alarm-bells were ringing To hold back the swelling tide Friends and lovers clinging To each other side by side  3 Mothers and their daughters Descending down the stairs Jumped into the icy waters Love and pity sent their prayers  4 The rich man Mister Astor Kissed his darling wife He had no way of knowing Be the last trip of his life  5 Calvin Blake and Wilson Gambled in the dark Not one of them would ever live to Tell the tale or disembark  6 Brother rose up gainst brother In every circumstance They fought and slaughtered each other In a deadly dance  7 They lowered down the lifeboats From the sinking wreck There were traitors there were turncoats Broken backs and broken necks  8 The bishop left his cabin To help all those in need Turned his eyes up to the heavens Said The poor are yours to feed  9 Davey the brothel-keeper Came out dismissed his girls Saw the water getting deeper Saw the changing of his world  0 Jim Backus smiled He never learned to swim Saw the little crippled child And he gave his seat to him  1 He saw the starlight shining Streaming from the East Death was on the rampage But his heart was now at peace  2 They battened down the hatches But the hatches wouldnt hold They drowned upon the staircase Of brass and polished gold  3 Leo said to Cleo I think Im going mad But hed lost his mind already Whatever mind he had  4 He tried to block the doorway To save all those from harm Blood from an open wound Pouring down his arm  5 Petals fell from flowers Tell all of them were gone In the long and dreadful hours The wizards curse played on  6 The host was pouring brandy He was going down slow He stayed right to the end and he Was the last to go  7 There were many many others Nameless here forever more They never sailed the ocean Or left their homes before  8 The watchman he lay dreaming The damage had been done He dreamed the Titanic was sinking And he tried to tell someone  9 The captain barely breathing Kneeling at the wheel Above him and beneath him Fifty thousand tons of steel  Verse 40 He looked over at his compass And he gazed into its face Needle pointing downward He knew he lost the race  Verse 41 In the dark illumination He remembered bygone years He read the Book of Revelation And he filled his cup with tears  Verse 42 When the Reapers task had ended Sixteen hundred had gone to rest The good the bad the rich the poor The loveliest and the best  Verse 43 They waited at the landing And they tried to understand But there is no understanding For the judgment of Gods hand  Verse 44 The news came over the wires And struck with deadly force The love had lost its fires All things had run their course  Verse 45 The watchman he lay dreaming Of all the things that can be He dreamed the Titanic was sinking Into the deep blue sea,,Tempest,True
