0,Lovesick Blues,Hank Williams,country,"[Chorus]
I got a feeling called the blues oh lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, ""Oh Lord""
The last long day she said goodbye
Well Lord I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of loving
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over; I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues

[Verse]
Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
But she don't care about me
Lord I tried and tried to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldn't stay
And now that she is leaving this is all I can say

[Chorus]
I got a feeling called the blues oh lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, ""Oh Lord""
The last long day she said goodbye
Well Lord I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of loving
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over; I lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues"

2,Babe,Sugarland,country,"[Verse 1: Sugarland]
What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said no one else, how could you do this, babe?

[Chorus: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you babe

[Verse 2: Sugarland]
What a waste
Taking down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
We said no one else, how could you do this, babe?

[Chorus: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time

[Bridge: Sugarland]
Since you admitted it, I keep picturing
Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it
I hate that because of you, I can't love you
Babe
What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe?

[Chorus: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
How could you do this, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you babe

[Outro: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
How could you do this, babe?
I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
You said I'm no one else, we ain't getting through this one, babe
I break down every time you call, this is the last time
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
This is the last time, this is the last time
You said I'm no one else, this is the last time
I'll never call you, babe"
3,You Are My Sunshine,Johnny Cash,country,"The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me and love another
You'll regret it all some day:

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

You told me once, dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between
But now you've left me and love another;
You have shattered all of my dreams:

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me
When I awake my poor heart pains
So when you come back and make me happy
I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away"
4,Say Something,Justin Timberlake,country,"[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Mhmm, yeah, alright
Ooh

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Everybody says, ""say something that says something”
“Say something that says something”
“Say something that says something”
I don't wanna get caught, up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have

[Verse 2: Chris Stapleton & Justin Timberlake]
Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere, there's melody and harmony
For you and me, tonight (whoa)
I hear them call my name

[Chorus: Chris Stapleton & Justin Timberlake]
Everybody says, ""Say something""
Then, ""Say something, say something""
Then, ""Say something, say something""
Then, ""Say something""
I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't get help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing

[Part-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)

[Outro: Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton]
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing"
5,Cry Pretty,Carrie Underwood,country,"[Verse 1]
I'm sorry, but I'm just a girl
Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keeping it together
I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Verse 2]
Oh no, you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain, so let it flow like a river

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

[Bridge]
Oh no, you can't
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, you can't cry
No, you can't cry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, woo
You can't cry
You can't cry pretty, baby
Oh yeah, woo, woo
No, you can't cry pretty, yeah"
6,Can't Help Falling In Love,Elvis Presley,country,"[Verse 1]
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you

[Chorus]
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

[Verse 2]
Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

[Chorus]
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

[Verse 3]
Take my hand
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you
For I can't help falling in love with you"
7,Meant to Be,Bebe Rexha,country,"[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go​ nowhere fast
Let's enjoy right here where we at

[Pre-Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
Who knows where this road is supposed to lead?
We got nothing, but time
As long as you're right here next to me, everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See, where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha]
I don't mean to be so uptight
But my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gon' lie, ain't gon' lie
'Cause I'm tired of the fake love
Show me, what you're made of
Boy, make me believe

[Pre-Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
Oh hold up, girl, don't you know you're beautiful?
And it's easy to see

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Florida Georgia Line]
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See, where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be

[Post-Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Florida Georgia Line]
So c'mon, ride with me, ride with me
See, where this thing goes
So c'mon, ride with me, ride with me
See, where this thing goes
Baby, if it's meant to be

[Bridge: Bebe Rexha & Florida Georgia Line]
Maybe we do
Maybe we don't
Maybe we will
Maybe we won't

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Florida Georgia Line]
But if it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be (take it, baby)
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be (c'mon)
Baby, just let it be (let's go)
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See, where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be

[Outro: Bebe Rexha & Florida Georgia Line]
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be"
8,Jolene,Dolly Parton,country,"[Guitar Introduction]

[Chorus]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

[Verse 1]
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

[Verse 2]
He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

[Chorus]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

[Verse 3]
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

[Chorus]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene"
9,Stay,Post Malone,country,"[Verse 1]
It's true that all that you know is all that you are
You said that it's all that you want and more
Fuck off and pour another drink
And tell me what you think
You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
You put your cigarette out on my face
So beautiful, please, woman

[Refrain]
Don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to...

[Verse 2]
Stay a little longer if you convince me
And tell me all the things that you have against me
Every time we make up, the truth is faded
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you

[Refrain]
But don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay

[Guitar Solo]
Mr. Andrew Watt, ladies and gentlemen

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay"
10,Mercy,Brett Young,country,"[Verse 1]
Mercy
Why you gotta show up lookin' so good just to hurt me?
Why you wanna stop this whole damn world from turning?
Mercy
Why you hanging on so tight if this ain't working?
Why you wanna stop this flame if it's still burning?
Cause it's still burning

[Chorus]
So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

[Verse 2]
If you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely
Wind up home alone please don't call me
And say you miss me, no

[Chorus]
So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

[Bridge]
Woah
Oh have mercy

[Chorus]
If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
If you're gonna take your shot, take it
Take it
Oh if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Mmmh if you ever loved me
Have mercy
Oh have mercy
Oh have mercy
Have mercy"
11,Something You Get Through,Willie Nelson,country,"When you lose the one you love
You think your world has ended
You think your world will be a waste of life
Without them in it
You feel there's no way to go on
Life is just a sad, sad song
But love is bigger than us all
The end is not the end at all

It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not ours to be taken
It's just a thing we get to do
Life goes on and on
And when it's gone
It lives in someone new
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through

It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not ours to be taken
It's just a thing we get to do

Life goes on and on
And when it's gone
It lives in someone new
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through"
12,In Hell I'll Be in Good Company,The Dead South,country,"Dead Love couldn't go no further
Proud of and disgusted by her
Push shove, a little bruised and battered
Oh Lord I ain't coming home with you

My life's a bit more colder
Dead wife is what I told her
Brass knife sinks into my shoulder
Oh babe don't know what I'm gonna do

I see my red head, messed bed, tear shed, queen bee
My squeeze
The stage it smells, tells, hell's bells, miss-spells
Knocks me on my knees
It didn't hurt, flirt, blood squirt, stuffed shirt
Hang me on a tree
After I count down, three rounds, in hell I'll be in good company

Dead Love couldn't go no further
Proud of and disgusted by her
Push shove, a little bruised and battered
Oh Lord I ain't coming home with you

My life's a bit more colder
Dead wife is what I told her
Brass knife sinks into my shoulder
Oh babe don't know what I'm gonna do

I see my red head, messed bed, tear shed, queen bee
My squeeze
The stage it smells, tells, hell's bells, misspells
Knocks me on my knees
It didn't hurt, flirt, blood squirt, stuffed shirt
Hang me on a tree
After I count down, three rounds, in hell I'll be in good company

In hell I'll be in Good Company"
13,What Ifs,Kane Brown,country,"[Verse 1: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
What if this goes south, what if I mess you up?
You say what if I break your heart in two, then what?

[Pre-Chorus: Kane Brown]
Well I hear you girl, I feel you girl, but not so fast
Before you make your mind up, I gotta ask

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Verse 2: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if the sky falls (sky falls)
Or the sun stops burnin'?
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'?
Or I could kiss you (you should kiss me)
What if you liked it? (bet I'd like it)
Well we ain't never gonna know unless we try it

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?
Awe yeah
C'mon

[Bridge: Kane Brown]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you?
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
Damn

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

Away (away)
What if?"
14,Самая вышка,Raim & Artur,country,"Строишь глазки, что за страсти
Подхожу к тебе немедленно
Со словом «Здрасьте»
Ты такая милая, ты такая красивая
Слов нет просто
Я просто в шоке
Твоё тело просто космос
Всё ближе-ближе, всё ближе-ближе
Повторяй за мной
Поднимая руки выше, ещё выше...ещё выше
Прошу танцуй со мной девушка из Парижа

Моя малышка, твоя улыбка
Ең әдемі, самая вышка...

Сені мен көрген сайын, как будто тебя знаю
Жақындап танысам десем орысша ой не знаю
Ай дауысын сенің, ай қимылын сенің
Майысқан шыбық белін, общем кайф әрбір жерін

Әдемісің до того, көзім тоймайды...
Кім болсада все равно сендей болмайды...
Моя малышка, твоя улыбка
Ең әдемі, самая вышка..."
15,Get Along,Kenny Chesney,country,"[Verse 1]
A man wearin' a t-shirt, says ""Virginia is for lovers""
Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other
He says ""All you're really given is the sunshine and your name""
We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

[Verse 2]
Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

[Bridge]
We find out when you die the keys to heaven can't be bought
We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not
Sometimes you got to

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along"
16,"Take Me Home, Country Roads",John Denver,country,"Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue ridge mountains, Shenandoah river
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

All my memories, gather round her
Miners' lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, to the country roads

I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me
Radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, to the country roads

Take me home, that country road
Take me home, that country road"
17,Hurt,Johnny Cash,country,"[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
18,Take It Easy,Eagles,country,"Well, I'm running down the road
Tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on
My mind

Four that wanna own me
Two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine

Take It easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels
Drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand
And take it easy

Well, I'm a standing on a corner
In Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed
Ford slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is
Gonna save me
We may lose and we may win though
We will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in
So take it easy

Well I'm running down the road trying to loosen
My load, got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my
Cover, she's so hard to find

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own
Wheels make you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is
Gonna save me, oh oh oh
Oh we got it easy
We oughta take it easy"
19,Lovesick Blues (Walmart yodeling kid),Mason Ramsey (Lil Hank Williams),country,"[Pre-Chorus]
Hey lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh lord
The last long day she said goodbye
Well lord, I thought I would cry

[Chorus]
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of loving
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over;
I lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues

[Verse]
Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
I'm In love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
But she don't care about me
And I tried and tried to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldn't stay
So now that she is leaving
This is all I can say
I got a feeling called the blues, oh lord
Since my baby say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh lord
The last long day she said goodbye
Well lord, I thought I would cry

[Chorus]
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of loving
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over;
I lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues"
20,Whiskey Lullaby,Brad Paisley,country,"[Verse 1: Brad Paisley]
She put him out
Like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night...

[Chorus:Brad Paisley &Alison Krauss ]
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, ""I'll love her 'til I die""
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

[Break:Brad Paisley &Alison Krauss]
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa

[Verse 2: Alison Krauss]
The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night..

[Chorus:Brad Paisley &Alison Krauss]
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

[Outro: Brad Paisley &Alison Krauss]
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa

Like a rainy Sunday morning makes me want to stay in bed
Twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs

[Bridge]
Stealing kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel

22,Most People Are Good,Luke Bryan,country,"[Verse 1]
I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
'Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot

[Chorus]
I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

[Verse 2]
I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But I'd still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
'Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

[Chorus]
I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

[Bridge]
I believe that days go slow and years go fast
And every breath's a gift, the first one to the last

[Chorus]
I believe most people are good
And most Mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe most people are good

24,Broken Arrows,Avicii,country,"[Verse 1]
You stripped your love down to the wire
Fire shy and cold alone outside
You stripped it right down to the wire
But I see you behind those tired eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Now as you wade through shadows that live in your heart
You'll find the light that leads home
Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

[Chorus]
Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

[Verse 2]
I've seen the darkness in the light
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that's black and white
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time

[Pre-Chorus]
We have to tear down walls that live in your heart
To find someone you call home
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

[Chorus]
Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

[Outro]
It's not too late, it's not too late
I see the hope in your heart
Sometimes losing, sometimes shooting
Broken arrows in the dark"
25,Smokin' and Cryin',Alex Roe,country,"Sittin' waitin' tables while she's sittin' waitin' for him to show
What her name or story was, maybe I'll never know
She ain't tryin' to hide what's goin' on inside, and I know I've been there before
Waitin' for somebody at the only place you'll see them anymore

Well, she's hidin' out there in her car, smokin' and cryin'
She don't have to go too far to figure out that she's dyin'
Thinks her cigarette'll make it better, but she's just lyin'
To herself about gettin' him back, she's still tryin'
Nothin's ever gonna change but the time, man, it's flyin'
While she's smokin' and cryin'

She sees him pull up in his old truck with a brand-new girl
I saw her face as she walked into the place, and it wrecked her world
I tried to go outside and give her my best advice and tell her it would be okay
But I just drank my coffee, and then I went on my way

Now she's hidin' out there in her car, still smokin' and cryin'
She don't have to go too far to figure out that she's dyin'
Thinks her cigarette'll make it better, but she's just lyin'
To herself about gettin' him back, she's tryin'
Nothin's ever gonna change but the time, man, it's flyin'

26,Life Changes,Thomas Rhett,country,"[Verse 1]
Waking up in my college dorm
Yeah, my life, it was pretty normal
Looking for a date to the spring formal
Wasn't worried 'bout nothing else, no
Majoring in Undecided
Notebook full of bad songs I was writing
Never dreamed anybody else would like them
Now they're sitting on a Walmart shelf

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up, ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

[Verse 2]
I bought a ring and she said, ""I do""
But everybody else said, ""Man, you're twenty-two
Whatcha trying to prove? Hey, why don't you wait?""
'Cause I've been waiting on her since the second grade, yeah
And now she got her own set of fans
She got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holding her hand
And now everybody wanna die happy, man

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

[Verse 3]
I remember the day I told my Daddy and Mama
""You're gonna have a grandkid, yep
From Uganda, that's right, we're adopting
And she is the cutest little girl that you've ever seen""
Well I was wrapping my head around being a dad
A big wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we had
Now Lauren's showing, got one on the way
Yeah that's two into two, hey, what can I say?

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no"

You and me in this moment
Feels like magic only

Saying how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful

28,Oh My Darling Clementine,Traditional,country,"Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

In a cavern, in a canyon
Excavating for a mine
Dwelt a miner, forty-niner
And his daughter, Clementine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Light she was and like a fairy
And her shoes were number nine
Herring boxes, without topses
Sandals were for Clementine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Drove she ducklings to the water
Ev'ry morning just at nine
Hit her foot against a splinter
Fell into the foaming brine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Ruby lips above the water
Blowing bubbles, soft and fine
But, alas, I was no swimmer
So I lost my Clementine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

How I missed her! How I missed her
How I missed my Clementine
But I kissed her little sister
I forgot my Clementine

Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine"
29,Criminal,Lindsay Ell,country,"[Verse 1]
I don't wanna close my eyes
Why pretend I'm going to sleep
When I know damn well I'm gonna keep lying here wide awake?
Waiting for the breath you take, to come back
I can't relax, I'm a tiger pacing in my cage
Cocked like a twelve guage
Feeling like a teenage crush
You're the habit that I can never get enough of

[Chorus]
Boy, what you do to me is criminal
Baby when I look in those eyes
I feel like going through stop lights
Looking at the cops like, I got nothing to lose
Yeah boy, you got me burning like a match stick
Take me to the edge and one step past it
It ain't right, it ain't typical
Oh, what you do to me is criminal

I, have the right to remain silent
But there ain't no way that I can
'Cause I'm wired like a ticking time bomb
It's so wrong, but it feels right
Tonight you repeating like an echo
Baby I can't let go, got me going klepto like a thief
Yeah I'd steal, just to keep on feeling what I feel

30,If We Were Vampires,Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit,country,"[Verse 1]
It's not the long, flowing dress that you're in
Or the light coming off of your skin
The fragile heart you protected for so long
Or the mercy in your sense of right and wrong
It's not your hands searching slow in the dark
Or your nails leaving love's watermark
It's not the way you talk me off the roof
Your questions like directions to the truth

[Chorus]
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone
Or one day you'll be gone

[Verse 2]
If we were vampires and death was a joke
We'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke
Laugh at all the lovers and their plans
I wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand
Maybe time running out is a gift
I'll work hard 'til the end of my shift
And give you every second I can find
And hope it isn't me who's left behind

[Chorus]
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone
Or one day you'll be gone

It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone
Or one day you'll be gone"

Liquor was the only love I'd known

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Verse 2]
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

And you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

32,Love Story,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: ""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'""

Why do the stars glow above?
Don’t they know it’s The End of the World

Why everything’s the same as it was
I can’t understand, no, I can’t understand

She wants to get married, she wants it perfect
She wants her granddaddy preaching the service
And she wants magnolias out in the country
Not too many people, save her daddy some money

Ooh, she got it all planned out
Yeah, I can see it all right now

[Chorus 1]
I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

[Verse 2]
I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah, I kinda freaked out, we've been friends forever
And I'd always wonder if she felt the same way
When I got the invite, I knew it was too late

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know her daddy's been dreading this day
Oh, but he don't know he ain't the only one giving her away

I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

Bet she got on her dress now, welcoming the guests now
I could try to find her, get it off of my chest now
But I ain't gonna mess it up, so I wish her the best now

So I'm in my black suit, black tie, hiding out in the back
Doing a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees

But she ain't gonna marry me
Whoa, but she ain't gonna marry me, no"

You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe

When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way

39,Dammit,Jana Kramer,country,"[Verse 1]
I was drivin' to town and I passed by a house
The one with pillars on the porch
Had a sign on the door said ""for sale""
So what the hell
I walked in, and sat down on some strangers couch
Solid Oak Hardwood floors
Didn't need to see more
'Cause I could hear you in the kitchen
Playin' your guitar
All our friends coming over
Little lights in the yard

[Chorus]
And dammit
Didn't we almost have it?
Honestly, I still don't understand it
We used to love to sit and talk and wish
And picture and planin'
Man, now I just...dammit

[Verse 2]
I think the owners could tell I was lost in myself
So they left me alone, said ""make yourself right at home""
I was already makin' dinner
Callin' you down the stairs
Little girl out the window
Hear her laughin' out there

Dammit
Didn't we almost have it?
Honestly, I still don't understand it
We used to love to sit and talk and wish
And picture and planin'
Man now, I just...dammit

We used to love to sit, talk and wish

Thinking ""oh, what a shame""
You can pray, you can hope
But you just never know
I guess that two bedroom picket fence magic
Can't ever be ours now, can it?

I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine

But when I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila

I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car

41,Country Song,Bo Burnham,country,"[Spoken]
Any big fans of country music out there? Yeah. Oh, some people extending my name - ""boo"" - that's also approval. I think country music gets a bad rep, ya know? Why is it that when Bruce Springsteen sings about a fucking turnpike, it is ""art,"" and then when someone sings about a horse, it's dumb, inherently. I think some of the greatest songwriters of all time are country artists. Dolly Parton... Willie Nelson, ya know? And if you're writing honestly, that is art, and I would never bash that. The problem is with a lot of modern country music, what is called ""stadium"" country music - the sort of Keith Urban brand of country music - is that it is not honest. It is the exact opposite of honest

[Music begins]

Where instead of people actually telling their stories, you got a bunch of millionaire metrosexuals that have never done a hard day's work in their lives. But they figured out the words and the phrases that they can use to pander to their audience. And they list the same words and phrases off, sort of mad-lib style, raking in millions of dollars from actual working-class people. You know the words, you know know the phrases, phrases like:

[Verse 1]
A dirt road
A cold beer
A blue jeans
A red pickup
A rural noun, simple adjective

No shoes
No shirt
No Jews
You didn't hear that
Sort of a mental typo

[Pre-Chorus]
I walk and talk like a field hand
But the boots I'm wearing cost three grand
I write songs about riding tractors
From the comfort of a private jet

[Chorus]
I can sing in Mandarin
And still know I'm pandering
Hunting deer and chasing trout
A Bud Light with the logo facing out

Hear that subtle mandolin
That's textbook panderin'
I own a private ranch that I rarely use
I don't like dirt

[Spoken]
One verse, one chorus in the bag
Now it's time to talk to the ladies
I'm hoping my Southern charm offsets all these rape-y vibes I'm puttin' out

[Verse 2]
Good girl
In a straw hat
With her arms out in a corn field
That is a scarecrow
Thought that was a human woman, sorry

A cold night
A cold beer
A cold jeans
Strike that last one

I'm wanting you
I hope you're feeling me
Subtextually

[Pre-Chorus]
We go to bed, you doze off
So I take your country girl clothes off
I put my hands on your body
It feels like hay, it's a fucking scarecrow again

[Chorus]
Like Mike’s Evander-ing
Fuck your ears, I'm pandering
I write songs for the people who do
Jobs in the towns that I'd never move to

Legalize gerrymandering
Tolerate my pandering
You got a beautiful mouth
I got a beautiful (dick)

Y'all dumb motherfuckers want a key change?

Thematically meandering
Emphatically pandering
I got a tight grip on my demo's balls
Say the word ""truck,"" they jizz in their overalls

You don't know what land you're in
I'm in the land of pandering
And I'll be upfront
I do what I do 'cause I'm a total fuckin' cunt-ry boy"
42,The Devil Went Down to Georgia,The Charlie Daniels Band,country,"The Devil went down to Georgia. He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind cause he was way behind. He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said ""Boy, let me tell you what.""

""I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too
And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul cause I think I'm better than you.""

The boy said, ""My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet; and you're gonna regret cause I'm the best there's ever been.""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show.""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this:

[Demonic violin piece]

When the Devil finished, Johnny said, ""Well, you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.""

""Fire on the Mountain."" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no

[Non-demonic violin piece]

The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again
Cause I've told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been.""
And he played:

""Fire on the Mountain."" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no"

44,The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia,Reba McEntire,country,"[Verse 1]
He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he thought he'd stop
At Web's and have him a drink 'fore he went home to her
Andy Wo-Lo said hello
He said, ""Hi, what's new?""
And Wo said, ""Sit down I got some bad news that's going to hurt""

[Verse 2]
Said, ""I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride isn't home tonight
Since you've been gone she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth""
Now he got mad and he saw red
Andy said, ""Boy, don't you lose your head
Because to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself""

[Chorus 1]
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

[Verse 3]
Andy got scared and left the bar
Walking on home because he didn't live far - you see
Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must have left town
So he went home and finally found the only thing
Daddy had left him and that was a gun

[Verse 4]
He went off to Andy's house
Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood and he started to shake

[Chorus 2]
The Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag them down
A big bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
""Why'd you do it?""

[Verse 5]
The judge said guilty on a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said supper's waiting at home and I got to get to it

[Chorus 1]
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

[Verse 6]
Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
That's one body that'll never be found
You see little sister doesn't miss when she aims her gun

[Chorus 1]
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands"

But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

Go on and shake your head and tell me that I'm wrong

But I know how you are 'cause I know how I am

Are you sitting at home, all alone, trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines

Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess

I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Verse 1]
Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on

Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door

Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk

On the inside of her thigh
There are little feathered Indians
Where we tussled through the night
If I'd known she was religious
Then I wouldn't have came stoned
To the house of such an angel
Too fucked up to get back home

Lookin' over West Virginia
Smoking Spirits on the roof
She asked ain't anybody told ya
That them things are bad for you
I said many folks have warned me
There's been several people try
But up till now, there ain't been nothing
That I couldn't leave behind

Sing your whispering song
Softly in my ear
And I will sing along
Honey tell me how your love runs true
And how I can always count on you
To be there when the bullets fly
I'd run across the river just to hold you tonight

Well my heart is sweating bullets
From the circles it has raced
Like a little feathered indian
Callin' out the clouds for rain
I'd go runnin' through the thicket
I'd go careless through the thorns
Just to hold her for a minute
Though it'd leave me wanting more

Hold me close my dear
Sing your whispering song

For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain!
America! America!
God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea!

O beautiful for pilgrim feet
Whose stern impassioned stress
A thoroughfare of freedom beat
Across the wilderness!
America! America!
God mend thine every flaw
Confirm thy soul in self-control
Thy liberty in law!

O beautiful for heroes proved
In liberating strife
Who more than self their country loved
And mercy more than life!

May God thy gold refine
Till all success be nobleness
And every gain divine!

Thine alabaster cities gleam
Undimmed by human tears!

Till souls wax fair as earth and air
And music-hearted sea!

Till paths be wrought through
Wilds of thought

Till nobler men keep once again
Thy whiter jubilee!"
52,All Along The Watchtower,Bob Dylan,country,"[Verse 1]
""There must be some way out of here""
Said the joker to the thief
""There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth""

[Verse 2]
""No reason to get excited""
The thief, he kindly spoke
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late""

[Verse 3]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too

[Verse 4]
Outside, in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl"

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door

Loud thunder heavy rain
Thin line between joy and pain
It's a long strange trip it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away

Pistons pumping
Minds are racing
It's hard to sleep man
When I'm shaking
Bad news surrounds me
Its always found me
Creeping up when things are good
Yeah the dark days find a way

All the things that
Make us turn from
What we see
It's always moving
It don't stop rolling

57,Before He Cheats,Carrie Underwood,country,"[Verse 1]
Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

[Hook]
That I dug my key into the side of his
Pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

[Verse 2]
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying ""I'm drunk""
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom polo
Oh, and he don't know

[Hook]
That I dug my key into the side of his
Pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

[Bridge]
I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

[Hook]
Cause I dug my key into the side of his
Pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires

Oh, maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

Oh, before he cheats"
58,Best Friend,Yelawolf,country,"[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Ain't never been much of the church type
But I believe in the last days
I walk through Hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathway
Say boy, what you doin' with your life
With those tattoos on your face?
Say boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way

[Hook: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believin' in
But if you spit on my fuckin' grave
And wish me hell, then I wish you well
I'ma send you straight up to my best friend

[Verse 3: Eminem and (Yelawolf)]
God, please would you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the llama, but I squashed my
Beefs, and things seem to be looking decent
Recently, but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though
Maybe not finna enter
The priesthood, but at least should make an attempt to
Show some remorse and to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher but a shit starter and finisher
Enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I get attacked
So I might say something back that might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap or
What I have to say on the mic, then you
Might wanna act just like quarterbacks
And take a fuckin' hike when I snap ‘cause I'm a sinner
And I (I got a best friend, best friend)
Plus balls and intestines
And they never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up
The minute I'm ever givin' it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it comin'
‘Cause failure's somethin' I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my gut
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button, don't tell me nothin'
You ain't my (best friend, best friend)
Who you think I'm talkin' 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a (best friend, best friend)
Shout it out like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power
Now when I blackout, power outage {Oww!}
They powerless, but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds
The black sheep, but I be the worst thing
That these motherfuckers ever heard when I'm counted out
You'll be D-O-A, they'll announce
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now
He's all around you {Blaow!}
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's im-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the Diggy Doc
Stiggy-stoppin' is not an option, somethin' I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth, like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in a suit
Talkin' to Proof droppin' a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock it and shoot
And who you think's my Glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And he'll be waitin' at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sendin' you hoes straight up to deal with my (best friend)

[Hook: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance
I can almost hear it

And they keep me going and my engine clean
Run me ragged but I don't fret

Cast your troubles on the Lord of Lord's
Or wind up laying on a coolin' board

And they keep me strutting when my feet hang low
Rotgut whiskey gonna ease my pain

66,I Lived It,Blake Shelton,country,"[Verse 1]
Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford
Flies found a hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Mama poured grease in a Crisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand
Where them yellow jackets torn me up
And I ain't making this up

[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it

[Verse 2]
Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow
Them ol' Duke boys were flattening the hills
Hollywood was fake, wrestling was real
Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawn mower around
I'd go back there right now

[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it

[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it"
67,Ex’s & Oh’s,Elle King,country,"[Verse 1]
Well, I had me a boy, turned him into a man
I showed him all the things that he didn't understand
Whoa, and then I let him go
Now, there's one in California who's been cursing my name
Cause I found me a better lover in the UK
Hey, hey, until I made my getaway

[Pre-Chorus 1]
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

[Chorus 1]
Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
Like ghosts they want me to make 'em O
They won't let go
Ex's and oh's

[Verse 2]
I had a summer lover down in New Orleans
Kept him warm in the winter, left him frozen in the spring
My, my, how the seasons go by
I get high, and I love to get low
So the hearts keep breaking, and the heads just roll
You know that's how the story goes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me

Climbing over mountains and a-sailing over seas

They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

My ex’s and the oh, oh, oh’s they haunt me
Like ghosts they want me to make ‘em O

68,In Case You Didn't Know,Brett Young,country,"[Verse 1]
I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I know that you've been wondering
Mmm, so here goes nothing

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Verse 2]
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
One of the things that I've been feeling
Mmm, it's time you hear em

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah you're my everything

In case you didn't know
I'm crazy bout you
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you

You had my heart a long long time ago

69,While You Still Can,Brothers Osborne,country,"Make amends with that old friend
You swore you'd never never talk to again
Because you miss him
Call up your mom on the telephone
Talk a whole lot of nothing til the cows come home
And listen
Cross every T, dot most the I's
'Cause years grow wings and fly on by
And time slips through your fingers just like sand

Because everything you thought would last forever
Never lasts forever, like you plan
Don't let your night become another
So take life by the hands while you still can

Get your daddy to tell that same old joke
And laugh between the jack and coke
And hope one day you'll be half as funny
Count your blessings and your stars
It's in the air and who you are
It's about the wealth you give
It sure as hell ain't about the money

Because everything you thought would last forever
Never lasts forever like you plan
Don't let your night become another
So take life by the hands while you still can

You just imagine
Anything can happen if you live every moment like your last

Because everything you thought would last forever
Never lasts forever like you plan
Don't let your night become another
So take life by the hands while you still can"
70,September,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
Do you remember
The 28th night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day

[Verse 2]
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now, December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember the love that we share today

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, golden dreams were shiny days

Do you remember
The 28th night of September?

Ai, ai, golden dreams were shiny days
And there never was a cloudy day
There never was a cloudy day"
71,Body Like a Back Road,Sam Hunt,country,"[Verse 1]
Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell off my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Verse 2]
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Bridge]
We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On the highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

I'ma take it slow
As fast as I can
Body like a back road
Drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand"
72,State of Grace,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is don’t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

[Outro]
This is a state of grace
This is a worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right"
73,Streets of London,Ralph McTell,country,"Have you seen the old man
In the closed-down market
Kicking up the paper
With his worn out shoes?
In his eyes you see no pride
Hand held loosely at his side
Yesterday's paper telling yesterday's news

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and
Lead you through the streets of London
Show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old girl
Who walks the streets of London
Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags?
She's no time for talking
She just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home in two carrier bags

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and
Lead you through the streets of London
Show you something to make you change your mind

In the all night cafe
At a quarter past eleven
Same old man sitting there on his own
Looking at the world
Over the rim of his teacup
Each tea lasts an hour
And he wanders home alone

So how can you tell me you're lonely
Don't say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and
Lead you through the streets of London
Show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old man
Outside the Seaman's Mission
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears
In our winter city
The rain cries a little pity
For one more forgotten hero
And a world that doesn't care

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and
Lead you through the streets of London
Show you something to make you change your mind"
74,Suspicious Minds,Elvis Presley,country,"[Intro]
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

[Chorus]
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

[Verse 2]
So, if an old friend I know
Drops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?

[Verse 3]
Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see these tears are real
I'm crying

[Chorus]
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

Oh let our love survive
Or dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die

The heart cracked, double down dreamer
The homesick for grass that's greener
And a slice of Mama's peach pie

To the flat broke, couch cushion gas money
The worker bee that ain't gettin' no honey
Missin' someone all the while runnin'
Gunnin' for the brighter lights

Here's to the break ups that didn't break us
The break down, wrong turn that takes ya

Makin' the best of the worst day kinda night

And a good friend we ain't seen in a while
And a slow dance left in these boots
And a chance at putting down new roots

The break down, wrong turn that takes ya

Nothing's going right

A pretty little blonde thing's looking your way
Makin' the best of the worst day kinda night
Yeah, it's making the best of the worst day kind of night

Oh
Here's to the breakups
It's that kinda night"

80,All Too Well,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in a car getting lost Upstate
The autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone, and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

[Verse 2]
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You taught me about your past thinking your future was me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Till you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well

[Verse 3]
Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

Because there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

81,Die Tonight,Adam Calhoun,country,"[Chorus: Upchurch]
I might die tonight, but if I do Imma be okay
And if I die tonight, at least I stood by the stuff I said
I got two graves dug, one for me and one for the motha fucker standing in my way
And if I die tonight, at least I can say I never ran away!

[Verse 1: Upchurch]
Six foot deep, deep deep in the cut
Shovel and a tarp rolled up in the truck
Couple old bikers and they know whats up
Spin my iTunes, shake em, I'm getting people roughed up
And a child molester might end up in the mud
Bones in the shit of a couple wild boars
Teeth buried in the lot of a little white church
I be somewhere dog GPS don’t work
When the cops all do things a little bit dirty
But they stay on my team, I got that baby face money
Ya’ll can buy all that jewelry, I’ll invest in my community
When we both go into the ground, fill it up with plenty shiny things
I got brass for days, pitbulls with teeth so razor sharp you’d think
My females slept with a great white shark
I ain’t tryna brag but my A-Team too big
Some crazy mother fuckers on that 1900’s shit
It’s time for a change, ya I came with some buddies
Who don’t mind getting muddy and bloody and standing for something
And putting some sense into this corrupt country
Go ahead big dog come over here and say something

[Chorus: Upchurch]
I might die tonight, but if I do Imma be okay
And if I die tonight, at least I stood by the stuff I said
I got two graves dug, one for me and one for the motha fucker standing in my way

[Verse 2: Adam Calhoun]
You can get it, Imma fight until the death of me
I ain’t never been on the run from an enemy
Heavily armed to the teeth, got an army with me
And I’m ready to die if you threaten me
AK’s, AR’s, you ain’t who you say you are
Bullets start flying, putting ghosts in the graveyard
Full moon lighting up the battlefield
Battle to my last breath and my blood splatter here
Just breathe a minute
Just think a minute
You don’t wanna go to war
Or we could get it, yeah we could bring it right to your front door
I don’t think you wanna go that route
I ain’t known to fuck around, fuck around
Imma throw a hundred rounds
Put your cold body in the fuckin' ground
Get the point bitch, when I hit you with the hollow round
What the fuck you talkin' bout
I don’t wanna talk about it
Leave your body right there layin' with some chalk around it
Why I gotta go so hard
Why you so fuckin' soft
Call your man runnin' bitch, you already fuckin' lost

[Chorus: Upchurch]
I might die tonight, but if I do Imma be okay
And if I die tonight, at least I stood by the stuff I said
I got two graves dug, one for me and one for the motha fucker standing in my way
And if I die tonight, at least I can say I never ran away!"

To brighten up even your darkest nights

[Chorus]
You just call out my name
And you know where ever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah, yeah
You've got a friend

[Verse 2]
If the sky above you should turn dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind should begin to blow
Keep your head together and call my name out loud
Soon I will be knocking upon your door

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Hey, isn't it good to know that you've got a friend?
People can be so cold
They'll hurt you and desert you
Well, they'll take your soul if you let them
Oh yeah, but don't you let them

Wish I was back in Texas
The ocean's no place for a squirrel
Wish I was in Texas
Prettiest place in the world, oh no

I guess deep in my heart I'll always be a Texas girl

I wanna go home, home, home, oh

I wanna go ho-oome

84,Parallel Line,Keith Urban,country,"[Verse 1]
You said ""I love you"" to me
And I don't know what that means
So frozen my feet
People use it too carelessly
And I couldn’t believe
That you would dive in so deep
And you said perfectly
Everything I’ve been feeling about you
It’s time to break the chains that held me back from you

[Chorus]
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line

[Verse 2]
Well I was never the type
To put it all on the line
But I've been changing my mind since you opened my eyes
It was the way that the light
Picked you out of that night
Then you were right by my side
Put a soul in my body
And now it’s time to close the space between the two of us

[Chorus]
So come on and
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line

[Bridge]
Oh, baby it's time
Oh, it's time

[Chorus]
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, I literally don't mind
Just please don't misplace it
Take a little bit of my
Heart tonight
No, baby be mine now
Baby, be mine now

Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line
And put our hearts in a parallel line"
85,Drinkin' Problem,Midland,country,"[Verse 1]
One more night, one more down
One more, one more round
First one in, last one out
Giving this town lots to talk about
They don't know what they don't know

[Chorus]
People say I got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

[Post-Chorus]
They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

[Verse 2]
Last call gets later and later
I come in here so I don't have to hate her
Same old folks, same old songs
The same old same old blue neon
The same old buzz, just because

[Chorus]
People say I've got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Just sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

Just a solution

It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem

86,Whiskey in the Jar,The Dubliners,country,"As I was a goin' over the far famed Kerry mountains
I met with Captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier
Saying ""stand and deliver"" for he were a bold deceiver

Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy

Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder
But Jenny drew me charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter

Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

'Twas was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken

Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

Now there's some take delight in the carriages a-rollin'
And others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
But I take delight in the juice of the barley
And courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early

Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

If anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney
And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenny
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny

Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar"
87,Barrett's Privateers,Stan Rogers,country,"Oh, the year was 1778
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
A letter of marque came from the king
To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
For twenty brave men all fishermen who
Would make for him the Antelope's crew
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
She'd a list to the port and her sails in rags
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

On the King's birthday we put to sea
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
We were 91 days to Montego Bay
Pumping like madmen all the way
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

On the 96th day we sailed again
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
With our cracked four pounders we made to fight
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

Now the Yankee lay low down with gold
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

Then at length we stood two cables away
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
Our cracked four pounders made an awful din
But with one fat ball, the Yank stove us in
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

The Antelope shook and pitched on her side
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
And the Main truck carried off both me legs
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

So here I lay in my 23rd year
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
It's been 6 years since we sailed away
And I just made Halifax yesterday
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers"

Say ""I think I love her"" when you leave that room

These fields don't grow overnight, this town wasn't built in a day
I'll be turnin' that dirt when the sun comes up
Goin' round in circles while that plane you're on takes you away
Chasin' down that sun in L.A, 2000 miles it ain't that far
Girl, wherever you are

[Chorus]
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you
Find your way back, I'll pray you do
I'll wait for you

The August rain, the break of dawn
Like anything worth countin' on
Comin' through, I'll wait for you

[Verse 2]
I'll keep the light on on the porch, I'll keep the key under the mat
Just in case I'm out there somewhere tryin' not to lose my mind
When you come back I know you gotta go
And if you don't girl you'll never know
And if you can't find what you want out there
I'll be right here, ain't goin' nowhere

92,Wagon Wheel,Darius Rucker,country,"[Verse 1]
Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

[Verse 2]
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train

Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train

93,Better Man,Little Big Town,country,"[Verse 1]
I know I’m probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn’t know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn’t 4am, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Verse 2]
I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it’s always on your terms
I’m hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You’re talking down to me like I’ll always be around
You push my love away like it’s some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I’d run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man

[Bridge]
I hold onto this pride because these days it’s all I have
And I gave you my best and we both know you can’t say that
You can’t say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would’ve become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would’ve been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man

And does he want you to be just a little more city?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel

[Chorus]
If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up

[Verse 2]
He hasn't even looked your way since you walked in
But I can't help it that I can't take my eyes off of you
Your favorite song just came on and me and you were singing along
And he don't even know a single word

[Chorus]
If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up
I'ma be the first to call baby

[Brdge]
Sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel

[Chorus]
If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up
Oh, if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up"
99,"Right Girl, Wrong Time",Jon Langston,country,"[Verse 1]
She talked with a drawl
Had me wrapped around her pretty little finger
Her eyes caught mine
Pulled me in like the tide; hook, line and sinker
I was hung up on her kiss
'Bout as good as it gets

[Chorus]
Cause she was the right girl
Yes, she was all mine
Thought about her all day
We spent every night
Chasing down the stars
Talking 'bout forever
But I learned the hard way
Never say never
It's too bad that clocks can't stop on a dime...
Cause she was the right girl
The right girl at the wrong time

[Verse 2]
Things can't stay the same
When we got a couple hundred miles between each other
Different states, we ain't
We ain't never been good at being long distance lovers
I guess it is what it is
And that's the heartbreak I still can't forget

[Chorus]
Cause she was the right girl
Yes, she was all mine
Thought about her all day
We spent every night
Chasing down the stars
Talking 'bout forever
But I learned the hard way
Never say never
It's too bad that clocks can't stop on a dime...
Cause she was the right girl
The right girl at the wrong time

[Bridge]
If two hearts were meant to be, they'll find their way I guess
But when goodbye started, man, I was a mess

[Chorus]
Cause she was the right girl
Yes, she was all mine
Thought about her all day
We spent every night
Chasing down the stars
Talking 'bout forever
And I learned the hard way
Never say never
It's too bad that clocks can't stop on a dime...
Cause she was the right girl
The right girl, at the wrong time"
100,Lady May,Tyler Childers,country,"I'm a stone's throw from the mill
And I'm a good walk to the river
When my workin' day is over
We'll go swim our cares away
Put your toes down in the water
And a smile across your face
And tell me that you love me
Lovely Lady May

Now I ain't the sharpest chisel
That your hands have ever held
But darlin' I could love you well
Til' the roll is called on high
I've seen my share of trouble
And I've held my weight in shame
But I'm baptized in your name
Lovely Lady May

Lord the wind can leave you shiverin'
As it waltzes o'er the leaves
It's been rushin' through my timber
Til' your love brought on the spring
Now the mountains all are blushin'
And they don't know what to say
'Cept a good long line of praises
For my lovely Lady May

Now I ain't the toughest hickory
That your ax has ever felled
But I'm a hickory just as well
I'm a hickory all the same
I came crashin' through the forest
As you cut my roots away
And I fell a good long ways
For my lovely Lady May"
101,When It Rains It Pours,Luke Combs,country,"[Verse 1]
Sunday morning man
She woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day 3 night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

[Chorus 2]
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

[Bridge]
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day 3 night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours"
102,Enchanted,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is
It was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered ""have we met?""
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was
Enchanting to meet you
All I can say is
I was enchanted to meet you

[Hook]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say ""hey""
It was
Enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was
Enchanted to meet you

[Hook]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew

This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Bridge]
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

[Refrein]
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you

[Hook]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew

This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Outro]
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you"

104,My Girl,Dylan Scott,country,"[Verse 1]
She looks so pretty with no makeup on
You should hear her talking to her mama on the phone
I love it when she raps to an Eminem song
That's my girl
Man, her eyes really drive me crazy
You should see her smile when she holds a baby
I can honestly say that she saved me
My girl

[Chorus]
Yeah, that's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene
That's my girl, sipping Crown and Sprite
In a ball cap, turned back, ooh, she got me like
Yeah, baby girl, you gone and done it again
Making all the guys wish that you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl


[Verse 2]
Every night when she goes to bed
She hits her knees and bows her head
Thanks the Lord for another day
I just thank Him for my girl

Yeah, that's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene
That's my girl, sipping Crown and Sprite

105,Heart Break,Lady Antebellum,country,"[Verse 1]
I paint my lips red, I turn my own head
Don't need nobody's help, zipping up my own dress
Pay my own tab, with my own cash, unattached
Sometimes the word alone, sounds like a sad song
But why's it gotta be, cause what I really need is a reset
And a deep breath, yeah

[Chorus]
I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a california king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break

[Verse 2]
It's just a little phase, give me a little space
You might see through it, but I'm putting on a poker face
Givin' love a rest, between my ex, and my next

I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound

106,The Older I Get,Alan Jackson,country,"[Verse 1]
The older I get
The more I think
You only get a minute, better live while you’re in it
'Cause it’s gone in a blink
And the older I get
The truer it is
It’s the people you love, not the money and stuff
That makes you rich

[Chorus]
And if they found a fountain of youth
I wouldn’t drink a drop and that’s the truth
Funny how it feels I’m just getting to my best years yet

[Verse 2]
The older I get
The fewer friends I have
But you don’t need a lot when the ones that you got
Have always got your back
And the older I get
The better I am
At knowing when to give
And when to just not give a damn

[Chorus]
And if they found a fountain of youth
I wouldn’t drink a drop and that’s the truth
Funny how it feels I’m just getting to my best years yet
The older I get

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
And I don’t mind all the lines
From all the times I’ve laughed and cried
Souvenirs and little signs of the life I’ve lived

[Verse 3]
The older I get
The longer I pray
I don’t know why, I guess that I
Got more to say
And the older I get
The more thankful I feel
For the life I’ve had, and all the life I’m living still"
107,Unforgettable,Thomas Rhett,country,"[Verse 1]
It was the 14th of October
Had that t-shirt off your shoulder
I was drunk, said I was sober
And you said yeah right
We were talkin’ for a minute
Then some guy tried to cut in
You took my hand and we pretended
Like I was your guy

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, then I tried to guess your middle name
For 30 minutes bet we played that game

[Chorus 1]
That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

[Verse 2]
We were dancin’, we were buzzin’
Takin’ shots like it was nothin’
Did the runnin’ man, you loved it
Yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair
And you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot
Where everything went down

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I told you I was gonna marry you
You probably didn’t think that it was true

[Chorus 2]
That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

Oh, that night was just like you, baby
I can taste the mango-rita you were drinkin’
And it feels just like it was last weekend
That we jumped in
Right off the deep end

That mango-rita you were drinkin’
And that Coldplay song that you were singin’
And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’
That it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do

108,Man Enough Now,Chris Bandi,country,"[Verse 1]
I was scared, I wasn't quite ready yet
Didn't want to let my freedom get
Too far away so I would say anything
To keep you just close enough
Like I need a little space to breathe
A little time for me to think
I just need you to wait for me
But you weren't waiting for me

[Chorus]
To grow up, get my shit together
Stop giving you the runaround, running from forever
It's too bad we happened when we did
'Cause I've learned a lot about life since then
I can't go back, girl I hate that
You fell in love with a kid trying to figure it out
'Cause I'm man enough now

[Verse 2]
I guess it's something that every boys gotta do
Getting so close to letting it slip through
Your fingers yeah, you gotta learn the hard way
Once you do you start to look back on
All the things that you should've, would've, could've done
Bet you never thought that I would

[Chorus]
Grow up, get my shit together
Stop giving you the runaround, running from forever
It's too bad we happened when we did

I can't go back, girl I hate that
You fell in love with a kid trying to figure it out

Make a girl like you wanna stay
It took a while for me to come around
But I am man enough now

I grew up, got it all together
I stopped running from forever
It's too bad we happened when we did
'Cause I've learned a lot about life since then

So if one more chance is something that you ever think about
I'm man enough now
I'm man enough now"
109,I Walk The Line,Johnny Cash,country,"[Chorus]
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse]
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds

110,Folsom Prison Blues,Johnny Cash,country,"I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

[Live From Folson Prison version]
SooooEEEE!!

I bet there's rich folks eating from a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away"
111,Die a Happy Man,Thomas Rhett,country,"[Verse 1]
Baby last night was hands down
One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man
A happy man baby

[Verse 2]
And baby that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You’re a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in the wildest dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man, yeah

[Bridge]
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace

[Chorus 2]
Oh if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man

[Post-Chorus]
Baby I could die a happy man
Oh I could die a happy man
You know I could die
I could die, I could die a happy man"

Taking flight, making me feel like

All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed"

115,Your Man,Josh Turner,country,"[Verse 1]
Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man

[Verse 2]
There's no hurry
Don't you worry
We can take our time
Come a little closer
Lets go over
What I had in mind
Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

I've been thinking about this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man

Ain't nobody ever love nobody
The way that I love you
We're alone now
You don't know how
Long I've wanted to
Lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about this all day long
Never felt a feeling that was quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man
I can't believe how much it turns me on

116,Hippies and Cowboys,Cody Jinks,country,"Well I started on the whiskey pretty early this morning
That’s alright, I was up all night
But I passed out before the sun came up
I really wanted to see one of those
I know that’s no way for a man to behave
With a mortgage due and a baby on the way
But somehow I made it to where I’m at
It’s been a living as a matter of fact

I get a bad attitude from being tired and running ‘round
I never ask for anyone to say they like my sound
I’ve never been a part of any musical scene
I ain’t just talking Nashville, if you know what I mean
They don’t write about me in their magazines
And I don’t ask for no reviews on the songs that I sing
I never had a lot of friends and I’m alright by that
But people keep on coming back

Raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys
They don’t care about no trends
They don’t care about songs that sell
Yeah, tomorrow I’ll be gone
So tonight everybody just sing along
Raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys

I’ve been standing on the outside for all of my life
But I like the view, I’m not gonna lie
Yeah, the yuppies and the hipsters and the wannabe scenes
That ain’t down home to me
I like two dollar beers, I like three dollar wells
At some old honky tonk bar that I know by the smell
Some old drunk on a bar stool on a Merle Haggard tune
That’s my kind of room

Raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys
They don’t care about no trends
They don’t care about songs that sell
Yeah, tomorrow I’ll be gone
So tonight everybody just sing along
Raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys

Raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys
They don’t care about no trends
They don’t care about songs that sell
Yeah, tomorrow I’ll be gone
So tonight everybody just sing along
Raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys"
117,Hello Beautiful,Noah Schnacky,country,"I was eighteen when we first met
Couldn’t believe how you took my breath
In your sweatshirt, your converse
You didn’t even know you were rockin’ my world

Sittin’ in line, tryin’ to get a coffee
Stealin’ looks, you turned around and caught me
I laughed, and you smiled
And we took a chance to stay for a while

Oh-woah-woah-woah
I never saw you comin’
Oh-woah-woah-woah
But I had to say somethin’

Hello beautiful, I’ve never seen you before
Do you live ‘round here, what’s your name beautiful?
The way you looked at me, girl it took my breath away
And I had to introduce myself, I just had to say

Hello beautiful, beautiful, woah-oo-woah
Hello beautiful, beautiful, woah-oo-woah

I got your name, and I got your number
We sat for hours, talkin’ to each other
But one night, just wasn’t enough
We were all in, fallin’ in love

I tried to see you but your daddy wouldn’t let me
He told you, you should just forget me
But what we had, was somethin’ so real and he
He didn’t know, the way we feel

Oh-woah-woah-woah
And so I met you in the dark
Oh-woah-woah-woah
Underneath the stars

Hello beautiful, it’s good to see you again
I’m glad you found your way down to this riverbend
I know we don’t have long, but I’ll take what I can get
Every moment spent with you is worth the consequence

Hello beautiful, beautiful, woah-oo-woah
Hello beautiful, beautiful, woah-oo-woah

And I remember when you called me
Something in your voice had changed
You told me you were moving with your dad to another state
I’m still waiting by this riverbend
Yeah I come here everyday

Waiting for that moment when you find your way
Back to me, and I’ll say

Hello beautiful
Hello beautiful"

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go

Ain't never been much of the church type
But I believe in the last days
I walk through Hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathway
Say boy, what you doin' with your life
With those tattoos on your face?
Say boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way

[Hook: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believin' in
But if you spit on my fuckin' grave
And wish me hell, then I wish you well
I'ma send you straight up to my best friend

[Verse 3: Eminem and (Yelawolf)]
God, please would you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the llama, but I squashed my
Beefs, and things seem to be looking decent
Recently, but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though
Maybe not finna enter
The priesthood, but at least should make an attempt to
Show some remorse and to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher but a shit starter and finisher
Enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I get attacked
So I might say something back that might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap or
What I have to say on the mic, then you
Might wanna act just like quarterbacks
And take a fuckin' hike when I snap ‘cause I'm a sinner
And I (I got a best friend, best friend)
Plus balls and intestines
And they never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up
The minute I'm ever givin' it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it comin'
‘Cause failure's somethin' I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my gut
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button, don't tell me nothin'
You ain't my (best friend, best friend)
Who you think I'm talkin' 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a (best friend, best friend)
Shout it out like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power
Now when I blackout, power outage {Oww!}
They powerless, but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds
The black sheep, but I be the worst thing
That these motherfuckers ever heard when I'm counted out
You'll be D-O-A, they'll announce
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now
He's all around you {Blaow!}
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's im-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the Diggy Doc
Stiggy-stoppin' is not an option, somethin' I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth, like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in a suit
Talkin' to Proof droppin' a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock it and shoot
And who you think's my Glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And he'll be waitin' at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sendin' you hoes straight up to deal with my (best friend)

Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

2,Burning House,Cam,country,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I had a dream about a burning house
You were stuck inside, I couldn't get you out
I laid beside you and pulled you close
And the two of us went up in smoke
Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone

[Chorus]
I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what’s lost and broke
And make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

[Verse 2]
See you at a party and you look the same
I could take you back but people don't ever change
Wish that we could go back in time
I'd be the one you thought you'd find
Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone

[Chorus]
I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what’s lost and broke
And make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

[Bridge]
The flames are getting bigger now
In this burning house
I can hold on to you somehow
In this burning house
Oh, and I don't want to wake up
In this burning house

[Chorus]
I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what’s lost and broke
And make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house"

You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still

Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons

It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe

Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one

5,My Church,Maren Morris,country,"[Verse 1]
I’ve cussed on a Sunday
I’ve cheated and I’ve lied
I’ve fallen down from grace
A few too many times
But I find holy redemption
When I put this car in drive
Roll the windows down and turn up the dial

[Chorus]
Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that’s my church

[Verse 2]
When Hank bring the sermon
And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold, cold heart burning
Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
Until my sins wash away

[Chorus]
Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that’s my church

Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM

[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

I ain't the dishrag, to come clean up, all the shit that ya dish out
Ain't got no check for 'em, if you checkin' in
Mothafucka check this out

[Chorus]
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, but what can I do if I do 'til it's gone

[Verse 2]
I'm not the trash can, not the last man at the finish line now
I'm not the new kid, on the block
That you can just follow and push around
I'm not the fuckin' needle in the haystack, that you finally found
This ain't no free rent, come and pitch a tent, you ain't tying me down
I'm not a bus ride you can hop inside, and just roll away clean
Not the wheel on the wagon you wanna break
'Cause I hold up the weight for the team
I'm not the gold watch, and the new truck
That you scheming to check out
Unless you're looking to check out *shot, shot, shot*
What a mess now (c'mon)

[Chorus]
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, what can I do if I do 'til it's gone

[Verse 3]
I jump to the sky for my people
I walk through the fire, I give love when it's equal
Don't tell me not to complain about my money and fame
When you come around and tellin' me I changed
Damn right I fuckin' changed
When this fuckin' change in my pocket
Hit the bucket, it was a rocket all a sudden
I went from shoppin' without nothin'
To goin' shoppin' for my cousins
Now that the cops know that I'm buzzin'
They wanna drop me in the oven
Pull me over just to say ""I'm a fan""
Hip-hop, gotta love it, fuck it

[Chorus]
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, what can I do if I do 'til it's gone"
11,Tennessee Whiskey,Chris Stapleton,country,"[Verse 1]
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from bein' too far gone

[Chorus]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Verse 2]
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

[Chorus]
And you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Outro]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey"
12,You Are My Sunshine,Johnny Cash,country,"The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me and love another
You'll regret it all some day:

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

You told me once, dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between
But now you've left me and love another;
You have shattered all of my dreams:

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me
When I awake my poor heart pains
So when you come back and make me happy
I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away"
13,Body Like a Back Road,Sam Hunt,country,"[Verse 1]
Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell off my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Verse 2]
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Bridge]
We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On the highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Outro]
I'ma take it slow
As fast as I can
Body like a back road
Drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand"
14,Lovesick Blues,Hank Williams,country,"[Chorus]
I got a feeling called the blues oh lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, ""Oh Lord""
The last long day she said goodbye
Well Lord I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of loving
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over; I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues

[Verse]
Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
But she don't care about me
Lord I tried and tried to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldn't stay
And now that she is leaving this is all I can say

[Chorus]
I got a feeling called the blues oh lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, ""Oh Lord""
The last long day she said goodbye
Well Lord I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of loving
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over; I lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues"
15,In Hell I'll Be in Good Company,The Dead South,country,"Dead Love couldn't go no further
Proud of and disgusted by her
Push shove, a little bruised and battered
Oh Lord I ain't coming home with you

My life's a bit more colder
Dead wife is what I told her
Brass knife sinks into my shoulder
Oh babe don't know what I'm gonna do

I see my red head, messed bed, tear shed, queen bee
My squeeze
The stage it smells, tells, hell's bells, miss-spells
Knocks me on my knees
It didn't hurt, flirt, blood squirt, stuffed shirt
Hang me on a tree
After I count down, three rounds, in hell I'll be in good company

Dead Love couldn't go no further
Proud of and disgusted by her
Push shove, a little bruised and battered
Oh Lord I ain't coming home with you

My life's a bit more colder
Dead wife is what I told her
Brass knife sinks into my shoulder
Oh babe don't know what I'm gonna do

I see my red head, messed bed, tear shed, queen bee

The stage it smells, tells, hell's bells, misspells
Knocks me on my knees

16,Take Your Time,Sam Hunt,country,"[Verse 1]
I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi
And I know your name
Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to

[Chorus]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just want to take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

[Verse 2]
And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know you're try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

[Chorus 2]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

[Bridge]
I don't wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you

[Chorus 3]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time"
17,Love Story,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: ""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'""

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Because we were both young when I first saw you"
18,Drinkin' Problem,Midland,country,"[Verse 1]
One more night, one more down
One more, one more round
First one in, last one out
Giving this town lots to talk about
They don't know what they don't know

[Chorus]
People say I got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

[Post-Chorus]
They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

[Verse 2]
Last call gets later and later
I come in here so I don't have to hate her
Same old folks, same old songs
The same old same old blue neon
The same old buzz, just because

[Chorus]
People say I've got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

[Post-Chorus 2]
They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Just sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

[Bridge]
Just a solution

[Chorus]
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

[Post-Chorus 2]
They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution"
19,Cruise - Remix,Florida Georgia Line,country,"[Intro: Brian Kelley & Tyler Hubbard]
Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Let's go!

[Bridge: Brian Kelley & Tyler Hubbard]
I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio up
What up Nelly, alright
I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio up

[Verse 1: Brian Kelley & Tyler Hubbard]
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs""
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said

[Chorus: Brian Kelley & Tyler Hubbard]
Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Come on
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Bridge: Brian Kelley & Tyler Hubbard]
I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio up

[Verse 2: Brian Kelley & Tyler Hubbard]
Yeah, she was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let’s go get this thing stuck""

[Chrous: Brian Kelley & Tyler Hubbard]
Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle

Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise


[Verse 3: Nelly]
My windows down my seats back
My music up and we ride
Her legs up on my dashboard
And it's just the way I like
Hey country girl, this country boy
Like e'rything about you
Don't change a thing, no way
You stay the same and I got you
I likes all that, all that
Head to toe you all that
Tell ole boy he can call back
Send her a text say, ""fall back"" cause
I can see you got a thing for the fast life
So come on, shawty, let me show you what the fast like
Whipping 'cross the border, Florida into Georgia
Cause baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every hood, every town with you
And this drop-top Chevy painted real slick
It would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Cause baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my, roll my, roll my
R-r-r-r-roll

Baby you're a song

20,American You,Yelawolf,country,"[Verse 1]
Man, you got it all worked out
Don't you? Old pair of shoes
Never wear your heart on your sleeve
Cause it don't go with the suit
You got a bad, bad woman with a young little pretty face
They told you not to go get married
But you went and did it anyway

[Chorus]
Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too

[Verse 2]
Mama said steer clear of the devil
So you never played in the road
Always lookin' on the bright side
So you never see the potholes
You got a house on a hill
Big news, that's a big deal
Big party with your big time friends
Man, imagine how that feels

[Chorus]
Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too

[Verse 3]
I believe in the modest dream, ain't lookin' for a pot of gold
A 6 pack and some good marijuana, I can watch my mama roll
I believe I could buy a few things like a house with a nice pool
Invite my nobody friends to the party and we’ll pee in it, fuck you

[Verse 4]
You got a blue-collar father who drinks Budweiser out the bottle
20 dollars, an old Impala, a baby's mama
You work hard, you don't beg, you don't borrow
Night at the factory, daytime job at McDonald's
Your daddy told you that girl was nothin' but a problem
But you fell in love 'cause to you she was like a supermodel
And they told you not to go get married
But you went and did it anyway
It ain't no problem
You make somethin' out of nothin', you make money for a livin'
Pushin' buttons, diggin' ditches, flippin' burgers in the kitchen
With the vision, you've been dreamin', you've been savin'
You've been given nothin' but shit
But you take it cause you're patient in this prison
Fuck everybody dissin', it ain't them who gotta live in this skin
With all these tattoos that you got that fuckin' offends them
If it's you that I'm speakin' to, you must be my extension
I take my drink up and sip it, take my hat off and tip it
Slumerican

[Chorus]
Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too
Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you
Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos
Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too"
21,Either Way,Chris Stapleton,country,"[Verse 1]
We pass in the hall
On our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk
Is when the monthly bills are due

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life
I'm past the point of give a damn
And all my tears are cried

[Chorus]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

[Verse 2]
It's been so long since I've felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate and you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
And it's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long

[Chorus]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
I won't love you either way

[Outro]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way"
22,Broken Arrows,Avicii,country,"[Verse 1]
You stripped your love down to the wire
Fire shy and cold alone outside
You stripped it right down to the wire
But I see you behind those tired eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Now as you wade through shadows that live in your heart
You'll find the light that leads home
Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

[Chorus]
Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

[Verse 2]
I've seen the darkness in the light
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that's black and white
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time

[Pre-Chorus]
We have to tear down walls that live in your heart
To find someone you call home
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

[Chorus]
Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

[Outro]
It's not too late, it's not too late
I see the hope in your heart
Sometimes losing, sometimes shooting
Broken arrows in the dark"
23,Unlove You,Jennifer Nettles,country,"[Verse 1]
I could break down and cry
Laugh it off and deny
Draw lines in the sand
And count on both hands
All the reasons why
This just won't work
It'll be nothing but hurt
I can swear that I don't
And maybe one day I won't
But for how hard I've tried

[Chorus]
I can't unlove you
And a heart can't unbreak
I can't unfeel how it felt
To feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I can't unknow this
Lord, I wish I knew how
But I can't unlove you
So come love me for now

[Verse 2]
If I were 25
I know just what I'd do
I would have already kissed
Till I was drunk on your lips
A thousand times too few
But we have other lives
And we know it ain't right
This is going nowhere
If I'm with you I don't care
Take me nowhere tonight

[Bridge]
They call it fire
But it feels just like drowning
With the weight of my burning desire
Closing in all around me
I wasn't lost until you found me

[Chorus]
And I can't unlove you
And a heart can't unbreak
I can't unfeel how it felt
To feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I can't unknow this
Lord, I wish I knew how
But I can't unlove you
So come love me for now

[Outro]
I can't unlove you
So come love me for now"
24,All Along The Watchtower,Bob Dylan,country,"[Verse 1]
""There must be some way out of here""
Said the joker to the thief
""There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth""

[Verse 2]
""No reason to get excited""
The thief, he kindly spoke
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late""

[Verse 3]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too

[Verse 4]
Outside, in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl"
25,You Broke Up with Me,Walker Hayes,country,"[Verse 1]
Well, I got some Coke in my bourbon
Surfin' the room like Swazye
No, I ain't drunk, I'm amazin'
Yeah, I got that laid way, way back, back in my swagger
X-Factor, feelin' no pain, I'm at the top of my game

[Pre-Chorus]
Darlin', you can't crash my party with your sorry's and what are we's
Don't start rainin' on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute
I ain't even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin', girl, you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)

[Chorus]
Whoa, girl, simmer on down a notch
Ain't nobody makin' you watch me get my forget you on
No, girl, can't touch my good as gold
I know it's difficult to see me on a roll
But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe, you broke up with me

[Verse 2]
Guess you don't know what you want
'Til you see 'em movin' on
Making lonely look like freedom
Baby, don't even act like I'm doing something wrong
If my song comes on and I get lost on that dance floor
In somebody's arms that ain't yours

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't crash my party with your sorry's and what are we's
Don't start raining on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute
I ain't even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin', girl, you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)

[Chorus]
Whoa, girl, simmer on down a notch
Ain't nobody makin' you watch me get my forget you on
No, girl, can't touch my good as gold
I know it's difficult to see me on a roll
But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe, you broke up with me

[Bridge]
For real, babe, ain't tryin' to rub it your face
I'm just breakin' off a little cold hard truth
It is what it is, girl, you did whatcha did, girl
I'm just doin' what a bachelor do

[Pre-Chorus]
Darlin', you can't crash my party with your sorry's and what are we's
Don't be raining on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute
I ain't even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin', girl, you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)

Whoa, girl, simmer on down a notch

Yeah, what can I say, babe, you broke up with me

You broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe?
You broke up with me"
26,Oh My Darling Clementine,Traditional,country,"Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

In a cavern, in a canyon
Excavating for a mine
Dwelt a miner, forty-niner
And his daughter, Clementine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Light she was and like a fairy
And her shoes were number nine
Herring boxes, without topses
Sandals were for Clementine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Drove she ducklings to the water
Ev'ry morning just at nine
Hit her foot against a splinter
Fell into the foaming brine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Ruby lips above the water
Blowing bubbles, soft and fine
But, alas, I was no swimmer
So I lost my Clementine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

How I missed her! How I missed her
How I missed my Clementine
But I kissed her little sister
I forgot my Clementine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine"
27,All Too Well,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in a car getting lost Upstate
The autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone, and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

[Verse 2]
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You taught me about your past thinking your future was me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Till you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well

[Verse 3]
Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
Because there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"

29,Take It Easy,Eagles,country,"Well, I'm running down the road
Tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on
My mind

Four that wanna own me
Two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine

Take It easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels
Drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand
And take it easy

Well, I'm a standing on a corner
In Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed
Ford slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is
Gonna save me
We may lose and we may win though
We will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in
So take it easy

Well I'm running down the road trying to loosen
My load, got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my
Cover, she's so hard to find

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own
Wheels make you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is
Gonna save me, oh oh oh
Oh we got it easy
We oughta take it easy"
30,Die a Happy Man,Thomas Rhett,country,"[Verse 1]
Baby last night was hands down
One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man
A happy man baby

[Verse 2]
And baby that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You’re a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in the wildest dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man, yeah

[Bridge]
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace

[Chorus 2]
Oh if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man

Baby I could die a happy man
Oh I could die a happy man
You know I could die
I could die, I could die a happy man"
31,Greatest Love Story,LANco,country,"[Verse 1]
They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect All-American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night, riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 2]
So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

[Chorus 2]
When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 3]
So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen

[Outro]
We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen
So baby say yes to me"
32,Accidental Racist,Brad Paisley,country,"[Verse 1: Brad Paisley]
To the man that waited on me
At the Starbucks down on Main
I hope you understand
When I put on that t-shirt
The only thing I meant to say
Is I'm a Skynyrd fan
The red flag on my chest somehow is
Like the elephant in the corner of the south
And I just walked him right in the room
Just a proud rebel son with an 'ol can of worms
Lookin' like I got a lot to learn
But from my point of view

[Chorus: Brad Paisley]
I'm just a white man coming to you from the Southland
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
We're still picking up the pieces, walking on eggshells, fighting over yesterday
And caught between Southern pride and Southern blame

[Verse 2: Brad Paisley]
They called it Reconstruction, fixed the buildings, dried some tears
We're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years
I try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin
But it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skin

[Chorus: Brad Paisley]
Cause I'm a white man livin' in the southland
Just like you I'm more than what you see
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
And we're still paying for our mistakes
That a bunch of folks made long before we came
And caught somewhere between southern pride and southern blame

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
Dear Mr. White Man, I wish you understood
What the world is really like when you're living in the hood
Just because my pants are sagging doesn't mean I'm up to no good
You should try to get to know me, I really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood
I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood
I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could
Feel like a new fangled Django, dodging invisible white hoods
So when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinking it's not all good
I guess we're both guilty of judging the cover not the book
I'd love to buy you a beer, conversate and clear the air
But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here

[Chorus: Brad Paisley (w/ LL Cool J ad libs)]
I'm just a white man
(If you don't judge my do-rag)
Comin' to you from the southland
(I won't judge your red flag)
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from
(If you don't judge my gold chains)
But not everything we've done
(I'll forget the iron chains)
It ain't like you and me can re-write history
(Can't re-write history baby)

[Verse 4]
Oh, Dixieland
(The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin')
I hope you understand what this is all about
(Quite frankly I'm a black Yankee but I've been thinkin' about this lately)
I'm a son of the new south
(The past is the past, you feel me)
And I just want to make things right
(Let bygones be bygones)
Where all that's left is southern pride
(RIP Robert E. Lee but I've gotta thank Abraham Lincoln for freeing me, know what I mean)
It's real, it's real
It's truth"
33,You Belong With Me,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me"
34,In the Blood,John Mayer,country,"[Verse 1]
How much of my mother has my mother left in me?
How much of my love will be insane to some degree?
And what about this feeling that I'm never good enough?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

[Verse 2]
How much of my father am I destined to become?
Will I dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone?
Will I let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

[Chorus]
I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?

[Verse 3]
How much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be?
Does a broken home become another broken family?
Or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

[Chorus]
I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?

[Chorus]
I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?"

36,Humble and Kind,Tim McGraw,country,"[Verse 1]
You know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget the keys under the mat
When childhood stars shine, always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your momma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

[Chorus]
Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

[Verse 2]
Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flying
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference with sleeping with someone
And sleeping with someone you love
""I love you"" ain't no pickup line, so
Always stay humble and kind

[Chorus]
Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kind
When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind

[Outro]
When it's hot, eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the AC and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kind
Don't take for granted the love this life gives you
When you get where you're goin'
Don't forget turn back around
And help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind"
37,"Take Me Home, Country Roads",John Denver,country,"Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue ridge mountains, Shenandoah river
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

All my memories, gather round her
Miners' lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, to the country roads

I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me
Radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, to the country roads

Take me home, that country road
Take me home, that country road"

Honey load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend I’m a shelter
For heartaches that don’t have a home

And choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that I’ll say, is...

[Chorus]
Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I’m not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Well, I wish I could say
That I’ve never been here before
But you know and I know
That I’ll always come back for more

Your love might be my damnation
But I’ll cry to my grave

Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I’m not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Take your best shot
Show me what you got

Love is a burning thing
And it makes a firery ring
Bound by wild desire

And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns

I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Verse 2]
Oh no, you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain, so let it flow like a river

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

[Bridge]
Oh no, you can't
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, you can't cry
No, you can't cry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, woo
You can't cry
You can't cry pretty, baby

It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming

Blame it all on my roots, I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know, the last one to show
I was the last one you thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise, and the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you, said, ""Honey, we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain""

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends
In low places

[Verse 2]
Well, I guess I was wrong, I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's alright, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean, to cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well I'll be as high as that ivory tower
That you're livin' in

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases

I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
And everything is alright
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
I didn't mean to cause a big scene
Just wait 'til I finish this glass
Then sweet little lady
I'll head back to the bar
And you can kiss my ass

Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away
And I'll be okay

You'll never reach it
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels lost, with no direction
My faith is shaken

But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle

You've been out ridin' fences
For so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
I know that you've got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones
That you can't get

Desperado
Oh, you ain't getting no younger
Your pain and your hunger
They're driving you home
And freedom, oh, freedom
Well that's just some people talking
Your prison is walking through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
And you're losing all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes
Away...

Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
(let somebody love you)
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late"

In the back of my mind making me feel like

Taking flight, making me feel like

51,Turtles All The Way Down,Sturgill Simpson,country,"[Spoken Intro]

I've seen Jesus play with flames
In a lake of fire that I was standing in
Met the devil in Seattle
And spent 9 months inside the lions den
Met Buddha yet another time
And he showed me a glowing light within
But I swear that God is there
Every time I glare in the eyes of my best friend

Says my son, ""It's all been done
And someday you're gonna wake up old and gray
So go and try to have some fun
Showing warmth to everyone
You meet and greet and cheat along the way""

There's a gateway in our minds
That leads somewhere out there, far beyond this plane
Where reptile aliens made of light
Cut you open and pull out all your pain
Tell me how you make illegal
Something that we all make in our brain
Some say you might go crazy
But then again it might make you go sane

Every time I take a look
Inside that old and fabled book
I'm blinded and reminded of
The pain caused by some old man in the sky
Marijuana, LSD
Psilocybin, and DMT
They all changed the way I see
But love's the only thing that ever saved my life

So don't waste your mind on nursery rhymes
Or fairy tales of blood and wine
It's turtles all the way down the line
So to each their own 'til we go home
To other realms our souls must roam
To and through the myth that we all call space and time"
52,Tempest,Bob Dylan,country,"[Verse 1]
The pale moon rose in its glory
Out o'er the Western town
She told a sad, sad story
Of the great ship that went down

[Verse 2]
T'was the fourteenth day of April
Over the waves she rode
Sailing into tomorrow
To a gilded age foretold

[Verse 3]
The night was black with starlight
The seas were sharp and clear
Moving through the shadows
The promised hour was near

[Verse 4]
Lights were holding steady
Gliding over the foam
All the lords and ladies
Heading for their eternal home

[Verse 5]
The chandeliers were swaying
From the balustrades above
The orchestra was playing
Songs of faded love

[Verse 6]
The watchman, he lay dreaming
As the ballroom dancers twirled
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the underworld

[Verse 7]
Leo took his sketchbook
He was often so inclined
He closed his eyes and painted
The scenery in his mind

[Verse 8]
Cupid struck his bosom
And broke it with a snap
The closest woman to him
He fell into her lap

[Verse 9]
He heard a loud commotion
Something sounded wrong
His inner spirit was saying
That he couldn't stand here long

[Verse 10]
He staggered to the quarterdeck
No time now to sleep
Water on the quarterdeck
Already three foot deep

[Verse 11]
Smokestack was leaning sideways
Heavy feet began to pound
He walked into the whirlwind
Sky splitting all around

[Verse 12]
The ship was going under
The universe had opened wide
The roll was called up yonder
The angels turned aside

[Verse 13]
Lights down in the hallway
Flickering dim and dull
Dead bodies already floating
In the double bottom hull

[Verse 14]
The engines then exploded
Propellers they failed to start
The boilers overloaded
The ship's bow split apart

[Verse 15]
Passengers were flying
Backward, forward, far and fast
They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
Each one more weary than the last

[Verse 16]
The veil was torn asunder
'Tween the hours of twelve and one
No change, no sudden wonder
Could undo what had been done

[Verse 17]
The watchman lay there dreaming
At forty-five degrees
He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking
Dropping to her knees

[Verse 18]
Wellington he was sleeping
His bed began to slide
His valiant heart was beating
He pushed the tables aside

[Verse 19]
Glass of shattered crystal
Lay scattered roundabout
He strapped on both his pistols
How long could he hold out?

[Verse 20]
His men and his companions
Were nowhere to be seen
In silence there he waited for
Time and space to intervene

[Verse 21]
The passageway was narrow
There was blackness in the air
He saw every kind of sorrow
Heard voices everywhere

[Verse 22]
Alarm-bells were ringing
To hold back the swelling tide
Friends and lovers clinging
To each other side by side

[Verse 23]
Mothers and their daughters
Descending down the stairs
Jumped into the icy waters
Love and pity sent their prayers

[Verse 24]
The rich man, Mister Astor
Kissed his darling wife
He had no way of knowing
Be the last trip of his life

[Verse 25]
Calvin, Blake, and Wilson
Gambled in the dark
Not one of them would ever live to
Tell the tale or disembark

[Verse 26]
Brother rose up 'gainst brother
In every circumstance
They fought and slaughtered each other
In a deadly dance

[Verse 27]
They lowered down the lifeboats
From the sinking wreck
There were traitors, there were turncoats
Broken backs and broken necks

[Verse 28]
The bishop left his cabin
To help all those in need
Turned his eyes up to the heavens
Said, ""The poor are yours to feed""

[Verse 29]
Davey the brothel-keeper
Came out dismissed his girls
Saw the water getting deeper
Saw the changing of his world

[Verse 30]
Jim Backus smiled
He never learned to swim
Saw the little crippled child
And he gave his seat to him

[Verse 31]
He saw the starlight shining
Streaming from the East
Death was on the rampage
But his heart was now at peace

[Verse 32]
They battened down the hatches
But the hatches wouldn't hold
They drowned upon the staircase
Of brass and polished gold

[Verse 33]
Leo said to Cleo
I think I'm going mad
But he'd lost his mind already
Whatever mind he had

[Verse 34]
He tried to block the doorway
To save all those from harm
Blood from an open wound
Pouring down his arm

[Verse 35]
Petals fell from flowers
Tell all of them were gone
In the long and dreadful hours
The wizard's curse played on

[Verse 36]
The host was pouring brandy
He was going down slow
He stayed right to the end and he
Was the last to go

[Verse 37]
There were many, many others
Nameless here forever more
They never sailed the ocean
Or left their homes before

[Verse 38]
The watchman, he lay dreaming
The damage had been done
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
And he tried to tell someone

[Verse 39]
The captain, barely breathing
Kneeling at the wheel
Above him and beneath him
Fifty thousand tons of steel

[Verse 40]
He looked over at his compass
And he gazed into its face
Needle pointing downward
He knew he lost the race

[Verse 41]
In the dark illumination
He remembered bygone years
He read the Book of Revelation
And he filled his cup with tears

[Verse 42]
When the Reaper's task had ended
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
The good, the bad, the rich, the poor
The loveliest and the best

[Verse 43]
They waited at the landing
And they tried to understand
But there is no understanding
For the judgment of God's hand

[Verse 44]
The news came over the wires
And struck with deadly force
The love had lost its fires
All things had run their course

[Verse 45]
The watchman he lay dreaming
Of all the things that can be
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the deep blue sea"

That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know

[Bridge]
You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah you're my everything

[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
I'm crazy bout you
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
Yeah, you had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
In case you didn't know"
54,Red,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

[Outro]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street"
55,Marry Me,Thomas Rhett,country,"[Verse 1]
She wants to get married, she wants it perfect
She wants her granddaddy preaching the service
And she wants magnolias out in the country
Not too many people, save her daddy some money

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh, she got it all planned out
Yeah, I can see it all right now

[Chorus 1]
I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

[Verse 2]
I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah, I kinda freaked out, we've been friends forever
And I'd always wonder if she felt the same way
When I got the invite, I knew it was too late

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know her daddy's been dreading this day
Oh, but he don't know he ain't the only one giving her away

[Chorus 1]
I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

[Bridge]
Bet she got on her dress now, welcoming the guests now
I could try to find her, get it off of my chest now
But I ain't gonna mess it up, so I wish her the best now

[Chorus 2]
So I'm in my black suit, black tie, hiding out in the back
Doing a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
Yeah, she gonna get married
But she ain't gonna marry me
Whoa, but she ain't gonna marry me, no"
56,Daylight,Yelawolf,country,"[Intro]
Daylight, woah daylight
Daylight, is coming again
Whiskey, woah whiskey
Whiskey, my only friend

[Verse 1]
Got me a bottle, lookin' out at my El Dorado
Smokin' a barro, whip up an egg and avocado
I'm on the porch like a slummy Ralph Lauren model
Flannel shirt like a lumberjack choppin' a log-o
Pistol next to the ashtray, no bow and arrow
Got blah blah though, knock the beef outcha top nacho
I'm livin' life like there is a tomorrow
I'm slow motion, I'm slow cookin'
The crock pot holds potatoes
I smell the storm comin', I like watching a sorrow
I like watching that muddy water fillin' up the potholes
I like hearing the woods cry, moan, whisper and sing songs
So I can think long; an aficionado
Raindrops on the string hit: a pizzicato
I'm free-fallin', the airplane pilot's on idle
Freezer lookin' like I hit the lotto
And I got beer colder than a Colorado hollow
Do you follow?

[Hook]
And just like the howlin' wolf
A couple sips down and it's nothin' but blues
Alcohol and rain, now that's what grown men do
You keep it one hundred, I keep a hundred proof
Cause when the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
When the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two
Unless you got some liquor to contribute
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded

[Verse 2]
Drinkin' 'til I'm heavily faded
All the sudden the suds I'm sippin' got me feelin' edumacated
I complicate the uncomplicated
My drinkin' partners are the greatest
Me and my buddy, Jack Davis
Daniels, whatever, we Jimmy Beamin', if we get lucky, maybe
We get a visit from the baby King 13 and go fuckin' crazy
Ten racks for a crystal chandelier full of liquid swazy
Now Patsy Cline got me walkin' after midnight
I'm tippin' the neck, gotta make sure to keep the lid tight
Was sittin' up with attention and now I just sit like
Slump down in my chair like a pimp, pondering this life
I'm the great grandson of Otis Williams
Part of me's Cherokee, the other part is a pilgrim
So me and firewater's like splittin' me up the middle
One's tryin' to love him, the other one's tryin' to kill a man

[Hook]
And just like the howlin' wolf
A couple sips down and it's nothin' but blues
Alcohol and rain, now that's what grown men do
You keep it one hundred, I keep a hundred proof
Cause when the raindrops fallin' on that old tin roof
I pour myself a glass of liquor and I get the blues
To get down, to get down I get loaded down
To get down I get loaded
Call me what you want but don't call past two

To get down, to get down I get loaded down

57,Ask Me How I Know,Garth Brooks,country,"You're stubborn as they come, you'll never settle down
You'll always be the one who doesn't stick around
You make all the rules, you're set in your ways
You gotta have your freedom, you gotta have your space

[Chorus]
But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

Go on and shake your head and tell me that I'm wrong
Say, ""I'm just another fool and this is just another song""
But I know how you are 'cause I know how I am
And I'd give anything to go back and try again

[Chorus]
But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

[Bridge]
And you best put this song on repeat
Maybe then you won't end up like me

[Chorus]
But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go

58,If We Were Vampires,Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit,country,"[Verse 1]
It's not the long, flowing dress that you're in
Or the light coming off of your skin
The fragile heart you protected for so long
Or the mercy in your sense of right and wrong
It's not your hands searching slow in the dark
Or your nails leaving love's watermark
It's not the way you talk me off the roof
Your questions like directions to the truth

[Chorus]
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone
Or one day you'll be gone

[Verse 2]
If we were vampires and death was a joke
We'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke
Laugh at all the lovers and their plans
I wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand
Maybe time running out is a gift
I'll work hard 'til the end of my shift
And give you every second I can find
And hope it isn't me who's left behind

[Chorus]
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone
Or one day you'll be gone

It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone
Or one day you'll be gone"

I wanna taste her lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume

Yeah, ‘cause maybe then, you’d want me just as much
I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush

[Verse 2]
I don’t get no sleep, I don’t get no peace

Lord knows I’ve tried, I can’t get her off my mind

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

They've all gone wherever they go

0,Lovesick Blues,Hank Williams,country,"[Chorus]
I got a feeling called the blues oh lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, ""Oh Lord""
The last long day she said goodbye
Well Lord I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of loving
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over; I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues

[Verse]
Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
But she don't care about me
Lord I tried and tried to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldn't stay
And now that she is leaving this is all I can say

I got a feeling called the blues oh lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, ""Oh Lord""

1,Cry Pretty,Carrie Underwood,country,"[Verse 1]
I'm sorry, but I'm just a girl
Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keeping it together
I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Verse 2]
Oh no, you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain, so let it flow like a river

[Chorus 1]
You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

[Bridge]
Oh no, you can't
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus 2]
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, you can't cry
No, you can't cry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

5,You Are My Sunshine,Johnny Cash,country,"The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me and love another
You'll regret it all some day:

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

You told me once, dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between
But now you've left me and love another;
You have shattered all of my dreams:

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me
When I awake my poor heart pains
So when you come back and make me happy
I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away"

8,Take It Easy,Eagles,country,"Well, I'm running down the road
Tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on
My mind

Four that wanna own me
Two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine

Take It easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels
Drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand
And take it easy

Well, I'm a standing on a corner
In Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed
Ford slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is
Gonna save me
We may lose and we may win though
We will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in
So take it easy

Well I'm running down the road trying to loosen
My load, got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my
Cover, she's so hard to find

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own
Wheels make you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is
Gonna save me, oh oh oh
Oh we got it easy
We oughta take it easy"
9,In Hell I'll Be in Good Company,The Dead South,country,"Dead Love couldn't go no further
Proud of and disgusted by her
Push shove, a little bruised and battered
Oh Lord I ain't coming home with you

My life's a bit more colder
Dead wife is what I told her
Brass knife sinks into my shoulder
Oh babe don't know what I'm gonna do

I see my red head, messed bed, tear shed, queen bee
My squeeze
The stage it smells, tells, hell's bells, miss-spells
Knocks me on my knees
It didn't hurt, flirt, blood squirt, stuffed shirt
Hang me on a tree
After I count down, three rounds, in hell I'll be in good company

Dead Love couldn't go no further
Proud of and disgusted by her
Push shove, a little bruised and battered
Oh Lord I ain't coming home with you

My life's a bit more colder
Dead wife is what I told her
Brass knife sinks into my shoulder
Oh babe don't know what I'm gonna do

I see my red head, messed bed, tear shed, queen bee
My squeeze
The stage it smells, tells, hell's bells, misspells
Knocks me on my knees
It didn't hurt, flirt, blood squirt, stuffed shirt
Hang me on a tree
After I count down, three rounds, in hell I'll be in good company

In hell I'll be in Good Company"
10,Hurt,Johnny Cash,country,"[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Outro]
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"
11,Stay,Post Malone,country,"[Verse 1]
It's true that all that you know is all that you are
You said that it's all that you want and more
Fuck off and pour another drink
And tell me what you think
You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
You put your cigarette out on my face
So beautiful, please, woman

[Refrain]
Don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to...

[Verse 2]
Stay a little longer if you convince me
And tell me all the things that you have against me
Every time we make up, the truth is faded
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you

[Refrain]
But don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay

[Guitar Solo]
Mr. Andrew Watt, ladies and gentlemen

[Chorus]
Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay"
12,Up Down,Morgan Wallen,country,"[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
Was Friday after five, I got here just in time
Went ahead and wet a line 'fore I went and lost my mind
I ain't been here long, but the bobbers in the pond
Going up down, up, down, up, down
Tonight, we're gonna raise a whole lot more than Cain
'Cause there's money in the bank and tomorrow's Saturday
So if they pass that fifth of Jack this way
I turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Florida Georgia Line]
We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up down...here

[Verse 2: Florida Georgia Line]
Yeah, the girls, they hit the spot, get hotter when it's hot
If you can't buy her a yacht, but still proud of what you got
'Cause when the day's done, red neck is from the sun
Going up, down, up, down, up, down

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Florida Georgia Line]
We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down here

[Bridge: Morgan Wallen & Florida Georgia Line]
Somebody pass that fifth of Camp this way
I'll turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down here"
13,Mercy,Brett Young,country,"[Verse 1]
Mercy
Why you gotta show up lookin' so good just to hurt me?
Why you wanna stop this whole damn world from turning?
Mercy
Why you hanging on so tight if this ain't working?
Why you wanna stop this flame if it's still burning?
Cause it's still burning

[Chorus]
So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

[Verse 2]
If you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely
Wind up home alone please don't call me
And say you miss me, no

[Chorus]
So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

[Bridge]
Woah
Oh have mercy

[Chorus]
If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
If you're gonna take your shot, take it
Take it
Oh if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Mmmh if you ever loved me
Have mercy
Oh have mercy
Oh have mercy
Have mercy"
14,Whiskey Lullaby,Brad Paisley,country,"[Verse 1: Brad Paisley]
She put him out
Like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night...

[Chorus:Brad Paisley &Alison Krauss ]
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, ""I'll love her 'til I die""
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

[Break:Brad Paisley &Alison Krauss]
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa

[Verse 2: Alison Krauss]
The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night..

[Chorus:Brad Paisley &Alison Krauss]
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

[Outro: Brad Paisley &Alison Krauss]
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa

15,"Take Me Home, Country Roads",John Denver,country,"Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue ridge mountains, Shenandoah river
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

All my memories, gather round her
Miners' lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, to the country roads

I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me
Radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, to the country roads

Take me home, that country road
Take me home, that country road"
16,Ring of Fire,Johnny Cash,country,"[Verse 1]
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a firery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell in to a ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

I fell in to a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire

The ring of fire
The ring of fire

17,Love Story,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: ""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'""

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Because we were both young when I first saw you"
18,September,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
Do you remember
The 28th night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day

[Verse 2]
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now, December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember the love that we share today

Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember

19,The Climb,Miley Cyrus,country,"[Verse 1]
I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
You'll never reach it
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels lost, with no direction
My faith is shaken

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

[Chorus]
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain’t about how fast I get there
Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

[Verse 2]
The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moments that I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep going

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I, I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on, 'cause...

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain’t about how fast I get there
Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side

Well I hear you girl, I feel you girl, but not so fast
Before you make your mind up, I gotta ask

What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?

21,Queen's Don't,RaeLynn,country,"[Verse 1]
I wasn't raised in a castle
I grew up on the outskirts of town
No dresses with golden tassels
The rings on my hand are handed down
But I'm gonna find the one that needs me, see's me
And treats me like I'm already royalty
There ain't nothing priceless on my wrist
I might not fly private, but that don't mean I ain't a queen

Queen's don't hate, queen's don't fight
Queen's don't stay unless their king treats her right, oh
Every jewel on my crown, you better believe I earned it
Won't keep people around that don't believe I deserve it
No, queen's ain't fake
A queen's gonna rule just the way she was made, oh
I ain't 'bout to let nobody come and take me off this throne
Some girls might, but queen's don't

No, I don't need the tallest tower
To prove to anyone I ain't weak
I turn my pain into power
Every tear's a diamond on my cheek

22,Oh My Darling Clementine,Traditional,country,"Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

In a cavern, in a canyon
Excavating for a mine
Dwelt a miner, forty-niner
And his daughter, Clementine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Light she was and like a fairy
And her shoes were number nine
Herring boxes, without topses
Sandals were for Clementine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Drove she ducklings to the water
Ev'ry morning just at nine
Hit her foot against a splinter
Fell into the foaming brine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

Ruby lips above the water
Blowing bubbles, soft and fine
But, alas, I was no swimmer
So I lost my Clementine

Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine

How I missed her! How I missed her
How I missed my Clementine
But I kissed her little sister
I forgot my Clementine

Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine"

I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot

I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights

I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But I'd still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt

Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don’t they know it’s The End of the World
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything’s the same as it was
I can’t understand, no, I can’t understand
How life goes on the way it does

[Verse 4]
Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Don’t they know it’s the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Don’t they know it’s the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye"

Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known

You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy

26,Get Along,Kenny Chesney,country,"[Verse 1]
A man wearin' a t-shirt, says ""Virginia is for lovers""
Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other
He says ""All you're really given is the sunshine and your name""
We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

[Verse 2]
Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

[Bridge]
We find out when you die the keys to heaven can't be bought
We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not
Sometimes you got to

Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along"

Hey
Been trying to meet you
Hey
Must be a devil between us
Or whores in my head
Whores at the door
Whore in my bed

Where
Have you
Been?
If you go, I will surely die

""Uh!""
Said the man to the lady
""Uh!""
Said the lady to the man she adored
And the whores like a choir
Go ""Uh!"" all night
And Mary, ain't you tired of this?
""Uh!""
Is
The

That the mother makes when the baby breaks

28,You Belong With Me,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me"
29,The Devil Went Down to Georgia,The Charlie Daniels Band,country,"The Devil went down to Georgia. He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind cause he was way behind. He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said ""Boy, let me tell you what.""

""I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too
And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul cause I think I'm better than you.""

The boy said, ""My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet; and you're gonna regret cause I'm the best there's ever been.""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show.""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this:

[Demonic violin piece]

When the Devil finished, Johnny said, ""Well, you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.""

""Fire on the Mountain."" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no

[Non-demonic violin piece]

The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again
Cause I've told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been.""
And he played:

""Fire on the Mountain."" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no"
30,Marry Me,Thomas Rhett,country,"[Verse 1]
She wants to get married, she wants it perfect
She wants her granddaddy preaching the service
And she wants magnolias out in the country
Not too many people, save her daddy some money

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh, she got it all planned out
Yeah, I can see it all right now

[Chorus 1]
I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

[Verse 2]
I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah, I kinda freaked out, we've been friends forever
And I'd always wonder if she felt the same way
When I got the invite, I knew it was too late

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know her daddy's been dreading this day
Oh, but he don't know he ain't the only one giving her away

[Chorus 1]
I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

[Bridge]
Bet she got on her dress now, welcoming the guests now
I could try to find her, get it off of my chest now
But I ain't gonna mess it up, so I wish her the best now

[Chorus 2]
So I'm in my black suit, black tie, hiding out in the back
Doing a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
Yeah, she gonna get married
But she ain't gonna marry me
Whoa, but she ain't gonna marry me, no"
31,Best Friend,Yelawolf,country,"[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Ain't never been much of the church type
But I believe in the last days
I walk through Hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathway
Say boy, what you doin' with your life
With those tattoos on your face?
Say boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way

[Hook: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believin' in
But if you spit on my fuckin' grave
And wish me hell, then I wish you well
I'ma send you straight up to my best friend

[Verse 3: Eminem and (Yelawolf)]
God, please would you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the llama, but I squashed my
Beefs, and things seem to be looking decent
Recently, but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though
Maybe not finna enter
The priesthood, but at least should make an attempt to
Show some remorse and to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher but a shit starter and finisher
Enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I get attacked
So I might say something back that might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap or
What I have to say on the mic, then you
Might wanna act just like quarterbacks
And take a fuckin' hike when I snap ‘cause I'm a sinner
And I (I got a best friend, best friend)
Plus balls and intestines
And they never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up
The minute I'm ever givin' it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it comin'
‘Cause failure's somethin' I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my gut
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button, don't tell me nothin'
You ain't my (best friend, best friend)
Who you think I'm talkin' 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a (best friend, best friend)
Shout it out like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power
Now when I blackout, power outage {Oww!}
They powerless, but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds
The black sheep, but I be the worst thing
That these motherfuckers ever heard when I'm counted out
You'll be D-O-A, they'll announce
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now
He's all around you {Blaow!}
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's im-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the Diggy Doc
Stiggy-stoppin' is not an option, somethin' I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth, like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in a suit
Talkin' to Proof droppin' a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock it and shoot
And who you think's my Glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And he'll be waitin' at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sendin' you hoes straight up to deal with my (best friend)

[Hook: Yelawolf]
To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance
I can almost hear it

Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah"
32,Broken Arrows,Avicii,country,"[Verse 1]
You stripped your love down to the wire
Fire shy and cold alone outside
You stripped it right down to the wire
But I see you behind those tired eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Now as you wade through shadows that live in your heart
You'll find the light that leads home
Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

[Chorus]
Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

[Verse 2]
I've seen the darkness in the light
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that's black and white
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time

[Pre-Chorus]
We have to tear down walls that live in your heart
To find someone you call home
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

[Chorus]
Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

It's not too late, it's not too late
I see the hope in your heart
Sometimes losing, sometimes shooting
Broken arrows in the dark"
33,Slow Burn,Kacey Musgraves,country,"[Verse 1]
Born in a hurry, always late
Haven't been early since '88
Texas is hot, I can be cold
Grandma cried when I pierced my nose
Good in a glass, good on green
Good when you're putting your hands all over me

[Chorus]
I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn, yeah

[Verse 2]
In Tennessee, the sun's goin' down
But in Beijing, they're heading out to work
You know the bar down the street don't close for an hour
We should take a walk and look at all the flowers

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn

Whatever feels good

Old soul, waiting my turn
I know a few things, but I still got a lot to learn
So I'm alright with a slow burn, slow burn, slow burn

34,All Along The Watchtower,Bob Dylan,country,"[Verse 1]
""There must be some way out of here""
Said the joker to the thief
""There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth""

[Verse 2]
""No reason to get excited""
The thief, he kindly spoke
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late""

Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too

Outside, in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl"

36,Before He Cheats,Carrie Underwood,country,"[Verse 1]
Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

[Hook]
That I dug my key into the side of his
Pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

[Verse 2]
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying ""I'm drunk""
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom polo
Oh, and he don't know

[Hook]
That I dug my key into the side of his
Pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

[Bridge]
I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

Cause I dug my key into the side of his
Pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires

Oh, maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

Oh, before he cheats"
37,All Too Well,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in a car getting lost Upstate
The autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone, and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

[Verse 2]
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You taught me about your past thinking your future was me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Till you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well

[Verse 3]
Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
Because there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"
38,Begin Again,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do
Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is but I do

[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

[Verse 2]
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

[Bridge]
And we walked down the block, to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time what's past is past

[Chorus]
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again"
39,Barrett's Privateers,Stan Rogers,country,"Oh, the year was 1778
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
A letter of marque came from the king
To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
For twenty brave men all fishermen who
Would make for him the Antelope's crew
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
She'd a list to the port and her sails in rags
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

On the King's birthday we put to sea
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
We were 91 days to Montego Bay
Pumping like madmen all the way
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

On the 96th day we sailed again
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
With our cracked four pounders we made to fight
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

Now the Yankee lay low down with gold
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

Then at length we stood two cables away
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
Our cracked four pounders made an awful din
But with one fat ball, the Yank stove us in
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

The Antelope shook and pitched on her side
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
And the Main truck carried off both me legs
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

So here I lay in my 23rd year
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
It's been 6 years since we sailed away
And I just made Halifax yesterday
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers"
40,Fire and Rain,James Taylor,country,"[Verse 1]
Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

[Chorus]
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend, but I always thought that I'd see you again

[Verse 2]
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand and I won't make it any other way

[Chorus]
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend, but I always thought that I'd see you again

[Verse 3]
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

[Chorus]
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain, now"
41,Jailhouse Rock,Elvis Presley,country,"[Verse 1:]
The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumping and the joint began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowing on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Number forty-seven said to number three
""You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 4:]
The sad sack was a sitting on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weeping all alone
The warden said, ""Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair""

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 5:]
Shifty Henry said to Bugs, ""For Heaven's sake
No one's looking, now's our chance to make a break""
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, ""Nix nix
I want to stick around a while and get my kicks.""

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock"
42,State of Grace,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is don’t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

[Outro]
This is a state of grace
This is a worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right"
43,Coming Home,Keith Urban,country,"[Verse 1: Keith Urban]
I wake up feeling, in my soul I'm
Living someone else's life
I'm turnin' into concrete, harder than these city streets
But no one even cares if I'm alive

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban]
I gotta get it right, mmm
Get it right, mmm mmm

[Chorus: Keith Urban]
There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like

I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home

My mind's heavy and I can't sleep, not even a memory
Is good enough to get me through the night, mmm

And all the ways to love me back to life

Mmm, I gotta get it right, ooh, yeah
Get it right, ooh, yeah

Wrap myself around you, never let you go (yeah!)
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home

[Outro: Keith Urban and Julia Michaels]
(Nothin' in the world)
I'm feeling lost in all the madness

These sidewalks filled with different faces (ooh-hoo)
So many places but there's none like mine

Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone 'cause
I can't fight it anymore

[Pre-Chorus: Hillary Scott]
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now

Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping
In the way you did before

For me it happens all the time

When I said I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said don't leave me here alone
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

46,Million Reasons,Lady Gaga,country,"[Verse 1]
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way

Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, ehh, ehhy

But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather

Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one

47,Wagon Wheel,Darius Rucker,country,"[Verse 1]
Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

[Verse 2]
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

[Verse 3]
Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel

48,If I Die Young,The Band Perry,country,"[Intro]
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Lord make me a rainbow I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you
When she stands under my colors
Oh and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

[Pre-Chorus]
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

[Bridge]
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
It's funny when you're dead how people start listenin'

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em

Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls"

In the back of my mind making me feel like

I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just want to know you better
Know you better, know you better now

You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall painted blue
And I'll take them down
Take them down and open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel like

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds

51,The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia,Reba McEntire,country,"[Verse 1]
He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he thought he'd stop
At Web's and have him a drink 'fore he went home to her
Andy Wo-Lo said hello
He said, ""Hi, what's new?""
And Wo said, ""Sit down I got some bad news that's going to hurt""

[Verse 2]
Said, ""I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride isn't home tonight
Since you've been gone she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth""
Now he got mad and he saw red
Andy said, ""Boy, don't you lose your head
Because to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself""

[Chorus 1]
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

[Verse 3]
Andy got scared and left the bar
Walking on home because he didn't live far - you see
Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must have left town
So he went home and finally found the only thing
Daddy had left him and that was a gun

[Verse 4]
He went off to Andy's house
Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood and he started to shake

[Chorus 2]
The Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag them down
A big bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
""Why'd you do it?""

[Verse 5]
The judge said guilty on a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said supper's waiting at home and I got to get to it

[Chorus 1]
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

[Verse 6]
Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
That's one body that'll never be found
You see little sister doesn't miss when she aims her gun

[Chorus 1]
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Because the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands"
52,I Lived It,Blake Shelton,country,"[Verse 1]
Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford
Flies found a hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Mama poured grease in a Crisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand
Where them yellow jackets torn me up
And I ain't making this up

[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it

[Verse 2]
Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow
Them ol' Duke boys were flattening the hills
Hollywood was fake, wrestling was real
Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawn mower around
I'd go back there right now

[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it

[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it"
53,Country Song,Bo Burnham,country,"[Spoken]
Any big fans of country music out there? Yeah. Oh, some people extending my name - ""boo"" - that's also approval. I think country music gets a bad rep, ya know? Why is it that when Bruce Springsteen sings about a fucking turnpike, it is ""art,"" and then when someone sings about a horse, it's dumb, inherently. I think some of the greatest songwriters of all time are country artists. Dolly Parton... Willie Nelson, ya know? And if you're writing honestly, that is art, and I would never bash that. The problem is with a lot of modern country music, what is called ""stadium"" country music - the sort of Keith Urban brand of country music - is that it is not honest. It is the exact opposite of honest

[Music begins]

Where instead of people actually telling their stories, you got a bunch of millionaire metrosexuals that have never done a hard day's work in their lives. But they figured out the words and the phrases that they can use to pander to their audience. And they list the same words and phrases off, sort of mad-lib style, raking in millions of dollars from actual working-class people. You know the words, you know know the phrases, phrases like:

[Verse 1]
A dirt road
A cold beer
A blue jeans
A red pickup
A rural noun, simple adjective

No shoes
No shirt
No Jews
You didn't hear that
Sort of a mental typo

[Pre-Chorus]
I walk and talk like a field hand
But the boots I'm wearing cost three grand
I write songs about riding tractors
From the comfort of a private jet

[Chorus]
I can sing in Mandarin
And still know I'm pandering
Hunting deer and chasing trout
A Bud Light with the logo facing out

Hear that subtle mandolin
That's textbook panderin'
I own a private ranch that I rarely use
I don't like dirt

[Spoken]
One verse, one chorus in the bag
Now it's time to talk to the ladies
I'm hoping my Southern charm offsets all these rape-y vibes I'm puttin' out

[Verse 2]
Good girl
In a straw hat
With her arms out in a corn field
That is a scarecrow
Thought that was a human woman, sorry

A cold night
A cold beer
A cold jeans
Strike that last one

I'm wanting you
I hope you're feeling me
Subtextually

[Pre-Chorus]
We go to bed, you doze off
So I take your country girl clothes off
I put my hands on your body
It feels like hay, it's a fucking scarecrow again

[Chorus]
Like Mike’s Evander-ing
Fuck your ears, I'm pandering
I write songs for the people who do
Jobs in the towns that I'd never move to

Legalize gerrymandering
Tolerate my pandering
You got a beautiful mouth
I got a beautiful (dick)

Y'all dumb motherfuckers want a key change?

Thematically meandering
Emphatically pandering
I got a tight grip on my demo's balls
Say the word ""truck,"" they jizz in their overalls

You don't know what land you're in
I'm in the land of pandering
And I'll be upfront
I do what I do 'cause I'm a total fuckin' cunt-ry boy"

Hey lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh lord
The last long day she said goodbye
Well lord, I thought I would cry

[Chorus]
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of loving
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over;
I lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues

[Verse]
Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
I'm In love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
But she don't care about me
And I tried and tried to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldn't stay
So now that she is leaving
This is all I can say
I got a feeling called the blues, oh lord
Since my baby say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh lord
The last long day she said goodbye
Well lord, I thought I would cry

She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of loving
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy

Stealing kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face

Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel

Make it easy with every little thing you do

It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uht

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, uh uh

Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I bet you wanted to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded, too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh
(Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about
The heartbreaks, it's time
Oh oh

[Chorus]
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I bet you wanted to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22
22
I don't know about you
22, 22

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news, I gotta have you
I gotta have you

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I bet you wanted to

Dancing like 22, yeah, 22, yeah yeah

57,Folsom Prison Blues,Johnny Cash,country,"I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

[Live From Folson Prison version]
SooooEEEE!!

I bet there's rich folks eating from a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away"

Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else

To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse

I bet you think you're first place
Yeah, someone should give you a ribbon
And put you in the hall of fame
For all the games that you think that you're winning

Well, I had me a boy, turned him into a man
I showed him all the things that he didn't understand
Whoa, and then I let him go
Now, there's one in California who's been cursing my name
Cause I found me a better lover in the UK
Hey, hey, until I made my getaway

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep

60,Enchanted,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is
It was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered ""have we met?""
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was
Enchanting to meet you
All I can say is
I was enchanted to meet you

[Hook]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say ""hey""
It was
Enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was
Enchanted to meet you

[Hook]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew

This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Bridge]
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

[Refrein]
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you

61,Happy & Sad,Kacey Musgraves,country,"[Verse 1]
It's not you, it's the glow of the party
The way that you've got me lit up inside
It's the song that they're playin', the words that you're sayin'
It's never felt so right

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous
When I'm having the time of my life

[Chorus]
Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?
Happy and sad at the same time
You got me smiling with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down
But I don't wanna come down

[Verse 2]
So is there a way to stop all this thinkin', just keep on drinkin'?
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
When they're turnin' the lights on and it turns out the joke's on me
'Cause it feels so right

I don't mind at all, no, I'm used to fallin'
I'm comfortable when the sky is gray
But when everything is perfect, I start hidin'
'Cause I know that rain is comin' my way, my way

'Cause I'm happy and sad at the same time
You got me smilin' with tears in my eyes

I can take the pain
Tell me that you mean it
That you won't leave again

Tell me what your heart wants
Such a simple thing
My heart is like paper
Yours is like a flame

I can't make you see
If you don't by now
I'll get through these chains
Somehow, somehow

Take it if you want it
I'm so tired I just don't care
Can't you see how much you hurt me?
It's like I wasn't there

63,If We Were Vampires,Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit,country,"[Verse 1]
It's not the long, flowing dress that you're in
Or the light coming off of your skin
The fragile heart you protected for so long
Or the mercy in your sense of right and wrong
It's not your hands searching slow in the dark
Or your nails leaving love's watermark
It's not the way you talk me off the roof
Your questions like directions to the truth

[Chorus]
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone
Or one day you'll be gone

[Verse 2]
If we were vampires and death was a joke
We'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke
Laugh at all the lovers and their plans
I wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand
Maybe time running out is a gift
I'll work hard 'til the end of my shift
And give you every second I can find
And hope it isn't me who's left behind

[Chorus]
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone
Or one day you'll be gone

It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone
Or one day you'll be gone"

65,Wasted Time,Eagles,country,"[Verse]
Well baby, there you stand
With your little head, down in your hand
Oh, my God, you can't believe
It's happening again
Your baby's gone and you're all alone
And it looks like the end

And you're back out on the street
And you're trying to remember
How do you start it over?
You don't know if you can
You don't care much for a stranger's touch
But you can't hold your man

You never thought you'd be alone
This far down the line
And I know what's been on your mind
You're afraid it's all been wasted time

The autumn leaves have got you thinking
About the first time that you fell
You didn't love the boy too much, no, no
You just loved the boy too well, farewell
So you live from day to day, and you dream
About tomorrow, oh

And the hours go by like minutes
And the shadows come to stay
So you take a little something
To make them go away
And I could have done so many things, baby
If I could only stop my mind from wondering what
I left behind and from worrying about this wasted time

Ooh, another love has come and gone
Ooh, and the years keep rushing on
I remember what you told me
Before you went out on your own
""Sometimes to keep it together
You got to leave it alone""

So you can get on with your search, baby
And I can get on with mine
And maybe someday we will find
That it wasn't really wasted time

I ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk
And I'm thinking
How I need your love, how I need your love
Yeah, it sinks in

[Chorus]
When I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Sorority t-shirt, the same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila
When I taste tequila
When I taste tequila
When I taste tequila"
75,Space Cowboy,Kacey Musgraves,country,"[Verse 1]
You look out the window while I look at you
Saying ""I don't know""
Would be like saying that the sky ain't blue
And boots weren't made for sitting by the door
Since you don't wanna stay anymore

[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
Guess I'll see you 'round again
I know my place, and it ain't with you
Well sunsets fade, and love does too
Yeah, we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, there ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space, cowboy

[Verse 2]
After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
And there ain't room for both of us in this town

[Chorus]
So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space

[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
Though we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space, cowboy"

You've been out ridin' fences
For so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
I know that you've got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones
That you can't get

Desperado
Oh, you ain't getting no younger
Your pain and your hunger
They're driving you home
And freedom, oh, freedom
Well that's just some people talking
Your prison is walking through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
And you're losing all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes
Away...

Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
(let somebody love you)
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late"

Too fucked up to get back home

Lookin' over West Virginia
Smoking Spirits on the roof
She asked ain't anybody told ya
That them things are bad for you

There's been several people try
But up till now, there ain't been nothing
That I couldn't leave behind

Sing your whispering song
Softly in my ear
And I will sing along
Honey tell me how your love runs true
And how I can always count on you
To be there when the bullets fly
I'd run across the river just to hold you tonight

Well my heart is sweating bullets
From the circles it has raced
Like a little feathered indian
Callin' out the clouds for rain
I'd go runnin' through the thicket
I'd go careless through the thorns
Just to hold her for a minute
Though it'd leave me wanting more

Hold me close my dear
Sing your whispering song

And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded

We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take

As everything was slipping right out of our hands

Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""

I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter

Oh, I can feel it, magic in your fingertips
And I can hear it in the words coming off your lips

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Even if you lose me, I will find you
There's no way to stop it, so don't try to

[Chorus]
Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing

[Bridge]
I used to be scared of the wilderness, of the dark
But not anymore, anymore, no

[Chorus]
Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing, yeah"
93,Broken Halos,Chris Stapleton,country,"[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

[Verse 1]
Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

[Verse 2]
Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

[Refrain]
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine"
94,One Number Away,Luke Combs,country,"[Verse 1]
Are you sitting at home, all alone, trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

[Chorus]
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Verse 1]
Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door

[Chorus]
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

[Bridge]
Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk
I just wanna hear your voice

[Chorus]
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away, away, away
Yeah I'm still one number away"
95,Last Kiss,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

[Chorus]
But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Verse 2]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

[Chorus]
But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

[Chorus]
So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

[Outro]
Just like our last"
96,Ask Me How I Know,Garth Brooks,country,"You're stubborn as they come, you'll never settle down
You'll always be the one who doesn't stick around
You make all the rules, you're set in your ways
You gotta have your freedom, you gotta have your space

[Chorus]
But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

Go on and shake your head and tell me that I'm wrong
Say, ""I'm just another fool and this is just another song""
But I know how you are 'cause I know how I am
And I'd give anything to go back and try again

[Chorus]
But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

[Bridge]
And you best put this song on repeat
Maybe then you won't end up like me

[Chorus]
But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know"
97,Holy Ground,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

[Chorus]
And darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

[Verse 2]
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of 'I need you'
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

[Chorus]
'Cause darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

[Hook]
Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you

[Chorus]
It was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

[Hook]
Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you"
98,Picture,Kid Rock,country,"[Verse 1: Kid Rock]
Living my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fueling up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord, I wonder if I'll ever change my ways

[Hook: Kid Rock]
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her

[Verse 2: Sheryl Crow]
I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows, but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waiting on you for a long time
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

[Hook: Sheryl Crow]
I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him
I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him

[Bridge: Sheryl Crow & Kid Rock, Both]
I saw you yesterday with an old friend
It was the same old same, how have you been?
Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey
You reminded me of brighter days
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church
I was off to drink you away
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

[Outro: Kid Rock & Sheryl Crow]
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you to come back home
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home
I just called to say I love you
Come back home

99,Dear John,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through... again
My mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda' known

[Verse 2]
Well maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?
I shoulda' known

[Bridge]
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping the lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

[Outro]
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song, you shoulda' known
You shoulda' known
Don't you think I was too young
You shoulda' known"
100,Red,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

[Outro]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street"
101,Back To December,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me, how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Interlude]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December...

[Chorus]
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Outro]
All the time"
102,The Gambler,Kenny Rogers,country,"On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life, out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right""

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

And when he finished speakin'
He turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done"
103,Heart Break,Lady Antebellum,country,"[Verse 1]
I paint my lips red, I turn my own head
Don't need nobody's help, zipping up my own dress
Pay my own tab, with my own cash, unattached
Sometimes the word alone, sounds like a sad song
But why's it gotta be, cause what I really need is a reset
And a deep breath, yeah

[Chorus]
I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a california king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break

[Verse 2]
It's just a little phase, give me a little space
You might see through it, but I'm putting on a poker face
Givin' love a rest, between my ex, and my next

[Chorus]
I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a California king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break

[Bridge]
Love, I'm over you (love, I'm over you)
It's long overdue
I think it's time to take a heart break (I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound)
I think it's time to take a heart break

[Chorus]
I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a california king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break"
104,Wonder Woman,Kacey Musgraves,country,"[Verse 1]
I like where this is going, and you like it, too
We rarely never ever don't see eye to eye
We're going to

[Pre-Chorus]
I can show you strong, I can fight for you
I can try to move mountains if you want me to

[Chorus]
But, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the love out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'
'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman

[Verse 2]
Bet all that gold gets heavy weighin' on her
I wonder if it's scary, always tryin' not to get hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
I know how it feels, it ain't easy
There's a reason why you only see it in the movies

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the truth out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'

[Bridge]
You don't know how to fly, no
That's okay, neither do I

[Chorus]
I know I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the love out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'
'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
Yeah, I know I ain't Wonder Woman"
105,Something You Get Through,Willie Nelson,country,"When you lose the one you love
You think your world has ended
You think your world will be a waste of life
Without them in it
You feel there's no way to go on
Life is just a sad, sad song
But love is bigger than us all
The end is not the end at all

It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not ours to be taken
It's just a thing we get to do
Life goes on and on
And when it's gone
It lives in someone new
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through

It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not ours to be taken
It's just a thing we get to do

Life goes on and on
And when it's gone
It lives in someone new
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through"

107,Drinkin' Problem,Midland,country,"[Verse 1]
One more night, one more down
One more, one more round
First one in, last one out
Giving this town lots to talk about
They don't know what they don't know

[Chorus]
People say I got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

[Post-Chorus]
They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

[Verse 2]
Last call gets later and later
I come in here so I don't have to hate her
Same old folks, same old songs
The same old same old blue neon
The same old buzz, just because

[Chorus]
People say I've got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

[Post-Chorus 2]
They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Just sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

[Bridge]
Just a solution

[Chorus]
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

They keep on talking
Drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution"
108,Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,country,"[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Bridge]
So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Outro]
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see"
109,Smokin' and Cryin',Alex Roe,country,"Sittin' waitin' tables while she's sittin' waitin' for him to show
What her name or story was, maybe I'll never know
She ain't tryin' to hide what's goin' on inside, and I know I've been there before
Waitin' for somebody at the only place you'll see them anymore

Well, she's hidin' out there in her car, smokin' and cryin'
She don't have to go too far to figure out that she's dyin'
Thinks her cigarette'll make it better, but she's just lyin'
To herself about gettin' him back, she's still tryin'
Nothin's ever gonna change but the time, man, it's flyin'
While she's smokin' and cryin'

She sees him pull up in his old truck with a brand-new girl
I saw her face as she walked into the place, and it wrecked her world
I tried to go outside and give her my best advice and tell her it would be okay
But I just drank my coffee, and then I went on my way

Now she's hidin' out there in her car, still smokin' and cryin'
She don't have to go too far to figure out that she's dyin'
Thinks her cigarette'll make it better, but she's just lyin'
To herself about gettin' him back, she's tryin'
Nothin's ever gonna change but the time, man, it's flyin'
She's smokin' and cryin'"
110,Streets of London,Ralph McTell,country,"Have you seen the old man
In the closed-down market
Kicking up the paper
With his worn out shoes?
In his eyes you see no pride
Hand held loosely at his side
Yesterday's paper telling yesterday's news

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and
Lead you through the streets of London
Show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old girl
Who walks the streets of London
Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags?
She's no time for talking
She just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home in two carrier bags

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and
Lead you through the streets of London
Show you something to make you change your mind

In the all night cafe
At a quarter past eleven
Same old man sitting there on his own
Looking at the world
Over the rim of his teacup
Each tea lasts an hour
And he wanders home alone

So how can you tell me you're lonely
Don't say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and
Lead you through the streets of London
Show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old man
Outside the Seaman's Mission
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears
In our winter city
The rain cries a little pity
For one more forgotten hero
And a world that doesn't care

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and
Lead you through the streets of London
Show you something to make you change your mind"
111,"My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)",Neil Young,country,"[Intro]
My my, hey hey
Rock and roll is here to stay
It's better to burn out than to fade away
My my, hey hey

[Verse 1]
Out of the blue and into the black
They give you this, but you pay for that
And once you're gone you can never come back
When you're out of the blue and into the black

[Verse 2]
The king is gone, but he's not forgotten
This is the story of a Johnny Rotten
It's better to burn out than it is to rust
The king is gone, but he's not forgotten

[Outro]
Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture than meets the eye
Hey hey, my my"
112,Rocky Raccoon,The Beatles,country,"[Verse 1]
Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, ""I'm gonna get that boy""
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

[Hook]
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

[Verse 2]
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better Doc, as soon as I am able

[Hook]
Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
A Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

[Outro]
C'mon Rocky boy
C'mon Rocky boy"
113,Wagon Wheel,Old Crow Medicine Show,country,"[Verse 1]
Headed down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbin' my way to North Caroline
Starin' up the road
And pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh
I can see my baby tonight

[Chorus]
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey, mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey, mama rock me

Runnin' from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time string band
My baby plays the guitar
I pick a banjo now
Ah, the north country winters keep a-gettin' me
And I lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave
But I ain't a-turnin' back
To livin' that old life no more

[Chorus]
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey, mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey, mama rock me

[Verse 3]
Walkin' due south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly
Had a nice long toke
But he's a-headed west from the Cumberland Gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name
And I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh
At least I will die free

[Chorus]
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey, mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey, mama rock me"
114,Velvet Elvis,Kacey Musgraves,country,"[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted was something classic
The kind love song that goes on 'til the end of time
All I ever wanted was a little magic
With a good laugh, jet-black sparkle in his eyes

[Chorus]
You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby

[Verse 2]
I don't really care 'bout the Mona Lisa
I need a Graceland kind of man who's always on my mind
I wanna show you off every evening
Go out with you in powder blue and tease my hair up high

[Chorus]
You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
You're my velvet Elvis, baby

[Bridge]
I knew it as soon as I felt it
Mm-mm, I knew it as soon as I felt it
Yeah

[Chorus]
You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
You're my velvet Elvis, baby, yeah"
115,All Summer Long,Kid Rock,country,"[Intro]
It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ahh Ahh Ahh
Ahh Ahh Ahh

[Verse 1]
Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

[Hook]
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

[Verse 2]
Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

[Hook]
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

[Verse 3]
Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again

[Hook]
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

[Outro]
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long"
116,Fireworks,First Aid Kit,country,"[Verse 1]
I could've sworn I saw fireworks
From your house last night
As the lights flickered and they failed
I had it all figured out

[Chorus]
Why do I do this to myself every time?
I know the way it ends before it's even begun
I am the only one at the finish line

[Verse 2]
I took a trip out to the frozen lake
And you felt so far away
But I could feel it washing over me
There's no escaping the harsh light of day

[Chorus]
Why do I do this to myself every time?
I know the way it ends before it's even begun
I am the only one at the finish line

[Bridge]
Stood out on that beach in Chicago
Woke up next to you on Silver Lake Avenue
Wherever I went I always knew, always knew
'Til I didn't know

[Chorus]
Why do I do this to myself every time?
I know the way it ends before it's even begun
I am the only one at the finish line

[Outro]
I could've sworn I saw fireworks
From your house last night"
117,Toes,Zac Brown Band,country,"[Chorus]
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today

[Verse 1]
Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars
Like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther, I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again

[Chorus]
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today

[Chorus 2]
Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for tequila and pretty señoritas
I'd have no reason to stay
Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
Going to lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play

[Verse 2]
Four days flew by like a drunk Friday night
As the summer drew to an end
They can't believe that I just couldn't leave
And I bid adieu to my friends

Because my bartender, she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
And I don't know if it's her or the rum

[Chorus]
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today

[Chorus 3]
Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Yes, and all the muchachas, they call me big papa
When I throw pesos their way
Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jaeger
And I'll grab my guitar and play
Adios and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay
The señoritas don't care when there's no dinero
Yeah, I got no money to stay

[Bridge]
Adios and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay

[Outro]
I'm just going to drive up by the lake
And put my ass in a lawn chair, toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world, a PBR on the way
Life is good today, life is good today"
