2,A Million Dreams,Pop,"[YOUNG P.T.]
I close my eyes and I can see
The world that's waiting up for me
That I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no one's been before
But it feels like home

They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I don't care, so call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design

'Cause every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled
With things from far away
The special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile
On a rainy day

They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy
Runaway to a world that we design

[P.T. BARNUM]
Every night I lie  in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

[CHARITY BARNUM, with P.T. BARNUM]
However big, however small
Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
You may be right, you may be wrong
But say that you'll bring me along
To the world you see
To the world I close my eyes to see
I close my eyes to see

Every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
A million dreams, a million dreams
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

For the world we're gonna make"
3,Rewrite the Stars,Pop,"[Verse 1: Phillip Carlyle]
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep saying our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away
And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That you're my destiny?

[Chorus 1: Phillip Carlyle]
What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours
Tonight

[Verse 2: Anne Wheeler]
You think it's easy
You think I don't want to run to you
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wondering why
Because we're able to be
Just you and me
Within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

[Chorus 2: Anne Wheeler]
No one can rewrite the stars
How can you say you'll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
It's not up to you, it's not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be
How can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours
Tonight

[Post Chorus: Both, Anne Wheeler, Phillip Carlyle]
All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
It's not impossible
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible

[Chorus 3: Phillip Carlyle and Anne Wheeler]
How do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine?
Nothing can keep us apart
Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
And why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changing the world to be ours

[Outro: Anne Wheeler]
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you
We're bound to break and
My hands are tied"

5,The Middle,Pop,"[Verse 1: Maren Morris]
Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

[Pre-Chorus: Maren Morris]
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

[Verse 2: Maren Morris]
Ohh, take a step
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still running, dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess? Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

[Pre-Chorus: Maren Morris]
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
I can't just let you go

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

[Bridge: Maren Morris]
Looking at you, I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless of my objection
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin
Just come over, pull me in, just

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Oh, baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle, no no
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh yeah, I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh, in the middle
Baby-y-y, why don't you just meet me in the middle, baby?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, middle?
In the middle, middle"
6,Be Careful,Pop,"[Intro]
Yeah
Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly—Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

[Bridge]
Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

[Verse 2]
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this love's got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me"

Look, I just want to break up all your shit, call your mama phone
Let her know that she raised a bitch, then dial tone, click
And fuck your little fake ass friends
Come around actin' like they my bros
I seen y'all little group texts
Where you all like to brag about your hoes
And you can tell your little bitch
I screenshotted all her naked pics
Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man?
Wake up and see your boobs on the 'Gram?
Lil' bitch, I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus
I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers
Smash your TV from Best Buy
You gon' turn me into into Left Eye
I don't wanna hear 'bout invasion of privacy
I had a feeling, it turns out you lie to me
I'm holdin' back everything that's inside of me
How you all fuckin' with bitches that follow me?

Beyoncé on my stereo, ""Resentment"" on repeat
I'ma make a bowl of cereal with a teaspoon of bleach
Serve it to you like, ""Here you go, nigga, bon appétit""
Look did you give it to her raw? You love her or nah?
You risk your whole home for a hoe from the bar?
You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches
You don't even cheat with no badder bitches
This shit is eatin' me, you sleepin' peacefully
Gettin' more mad at you, thinkin' 'bout stabbin' you
Don't even know that you this close to dyin'
You gon' wake up like, ""Why you got an attitude?""

I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002
We were only eleven
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing ""love is forever and ever""
Well, I guess that was true

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs

Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to 2002

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it

It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone

Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, I can't look away, I just gotta say

Swear to God I'm down if you're down all you gotta say is right
Girl anything I can do just to make you feel alright

Running circles 'round my mind
Even when it's rainy all you ever do is shine
You on fire, you a star just like Mariah
Man this feel incredible, I'll turn you into a bride, you're mine

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I’ll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We’re just friends, what are you saying?
Said ""There’s another,"" and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like...

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
(Luda)
When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, no one could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don’t need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really want to see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep on saying

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh

[Verse 2]
Waktu ke waktu perlahan kurakit egoku
Merangkul orang-orang yang mulai sejiwa denganku
Ke-BM-an membukakan jalan mencari teman
Bergeraklah dari zona nyaman

[Chorus]
Sembilu yang dulu
Biarlah berlalu
Bekerja bersama hati
Kita ini insan bukan seekor sapi

Sembilu yang dulu
Biarlah membiru
Berkarya bersama hati

Diam dan mati
Milik dia yang tak bisa berdiri, berdiri
Diam dan mati
Milik dia yang tak bisa berdiri
Berdiri di kakinya sendiri

[Chorus]
Sembilu yang dulu
Biarlah berlalu
Bekerja bersama hati
Kita ini insan bukan seekor sapi

Sembilu yang dulu
Biarlah membiru
Berkarya bersama hati

Tanamkan pesanku
Agar tak keliru
Bekerja bersama hati"

Pick up the phone, show me it was real
Pick up the phone

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, I don't wanna put no pressure on ya
I just wanna put a blessing on ya
Since our last undressin' session
I'm not really sure if you've been checkin'
I'm progressin', I just heard my songs
Is poppin' out in Macedonia
And even Serbia, I don't mean to burden ya
If you got a man since then, I understand
Last thing I wanna do is get you jammed
'Specially if he's a fan
He'll prolly never wanna hear my shit again
And I need every single SoundScan
But if you single and you down, then...
I'm in your town fiendin' for another round
I was countin' down the days
Been more patient than a Browns fan
Where that chip at?
Prolly on your shoulder, 'cause I forgot to hit back
Left you on read, apologies are said
But often never meant, well fuck that, I repent
For message never sent, now...

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Hello, stranger
It's been a minute since we last kicked it
And by the way, just got in town
And I won't let cumulus clouds all in the sky ruin my vibe
Usually, I don't do this often
But since recruiting isn't an option
Due to unusual rain and thunder
Baby, I wonder, baby, I wonder, would you just

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Put your sweats on, put your sweats on for me, yeah

Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill

Hello, stranger, vape's been waiting
And just as I recall, that ass is still amazing
I'm playin', baby; nah I'm sayin', baby

So go ahead and pour the drink up
I'm so glad we got to link up, uh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Get to takin' that off, takin' that off for me, yeah yeah
'Cause I got the plug, I made the call for green
I'm talkin' late-night for you

Don't make me wait, no, don't you, no, no

Just say you will, will, will  yeah
Come through and chill, chill, chill

She hit back, shit that's a good sign... yeah
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Ayy, Gucc, can I tell her some real shit? Yeah

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
In case my lack of reply had you catchin' them feelings
Know you've been on my mind like Kaepernick kneelin'
Or police killings, or Trump sayin' slick shit
Manipulatin' poor white folks because they ignant
Blind to the struggles of the ones that got the pigment
Lately I've been stressin' 'cause it seems so malignant
I need to feel your essence in my presence if you're with it
I guarantee you won't regret you did it if you come through

[Chorus: Miguel]
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just say you will, will, will

Come through and chill, chill, chill
I wanna f... all night (say it)

Just say you will, will, will
I wanna f... all night (say it)

Said he tried to phone me, but I never have time
He said that I never listen, but I don't even try
I got a new place in Cali, but I'm gone every night
So I fill it with strangers so they keep on the lights
She said she told you she knows me, but the face isn't right
She asked if I recognized her and I told her I might

I stayed a night out in Paris where they don't know my name
And I got into some trouble with that drink in my veins
I got a problem with parties 'cause it's loud in my brain
And I can never say sorry 'cause I won't take the blame
I know I always go missing and you're lying awake
But if you ask why I'm distant, oh, I'm running away

You know that everywhere I go

I'm trying to hold my breath
Let it stay this way
Can't let this moment end
You set off a dream with me
Getting louder now
Can you hear it echoing?
Take my hand
Will you share this with me?
'Cause darling without you

All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the nightsky
Will never be enough
Never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but it'll
Never be enough
Never be enough

For me
Never, never
Never, never
Never, for me
For me
Never enough
Never enough

40,Shape of You,Pop,"[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body

Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I know the feeling haunt you

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

All the stars are closer

[Verse 2: SZA]
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin', I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no off switch
And the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I, I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we were runnin' out of time

Love, let's talk about love

[Verse 1]
Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

[Chorus]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hopin'
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love to come around

[Verse 2]
We are one of a kind, irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical?
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated

[Chorus]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hopin'
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love to come around

さよならの
前に let go
でも心の迷路
の中で迷う

ステレオから Monoへ
分かれ道 はそう
これが散りゆく運命ならば
My last letter
綴る言葉、書いては消してる
君への想いはso many to let go
Unpuzzle my lego

元の形に戻れないlevel
So be it don’t cry
I’ma let you go and fly
忙しなくする日々
Keeping myself busy

紛らわすため埋め込んだschedule
でも忘れられないよ
脳裏に焼き付いてるlike tattoo
あの頃には戻れないね
出来ることならcall your name
No…but 受け止めるyour blame
本当にit is time to say goodbye

さよならの
前に let go
でも心の迷路
の中で迷う
ステレオから Monoへ
分かれ道 はそう
続くだろう
今君の手を
離せるように



I gotta let you know
That I need to let you go
Hard to say goodbye
でも逃げない
I’m ready to let go
I’m ready to let go
I’m ready to let go

今頃どこで何をしてる
遠く離れて誰を想う
君がいない生活はもう、
Unbelievable
それでも行くしかねーんだ
俺が愛し過ぎた人
絡み過ぎて絡みあった糸
解けなくなって別の道を歩む

そのためにI’ll say goodbye
始まりはいつの日も
雨の中隠した涙の先に
待ってるやり直そう
また未来で笑顔で
会えるように
今君の手を
離せるように

I gotta let you know
That I need to let you go
Hard to say goodbye
でも逃げない

I’m ready to let go
I’m ready to let go
I’m ready to let go



二人で見た空の色
二人がいた道の香り
忘れないでいて
今君の手を
離せるように

I gotta let you know
That I need to let you go
Hard to say goodbye
でも逃げない

I’m ready to let go
I’m ready to let go
I’m ready to let go
I’m ready to let go
I’m ready to let go"

Tak semua menjadi kenyataan

Apakah kau cuba untuk menafikan
Keikhlasan hatiku padamu
Betapa ku mencuba
Mendapatkan secebis kasih mu

Apakah kau tak mampu untuk menentukan
Di antara kaca dan permata
Betapa telahan mu
Memaksa ku mengundurkan diri

Dan tak seharusnya aku
Bertemu dirimu di dunia ini
Dan kau membuang diriku sesuka hati mu
Dan memilih dia
Dan ku tersandar begini
Meratapi hati yang telah dilukai
Aku sedar betapa hinanya
Ku di matamu

Namun jika ku diperlukan, dan diterima
Izinkan ku menagih kasihmu
Namun jika ku ditolak, tak diperlukan
Buang segala tentang ku

Dan tak seharusnya aku
Bertemu dirimu di dunia ini

Dan memilih dia

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ﻿I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older

I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus 1: Ed Sheeran]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2: Beyoncé, Ed Sheeran & Both]
Well, baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms

City of stars
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars
There's so much that I can't see
Who knows?
I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you
That now our dreams
They've finally come true

[Mia's Verse: Emma Stone & Ryan Gosling]
City of stars
Just one thing everybody wants
There in the bars
And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
It's love
Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else
A rush
A glance
A touch
A dance

[Duet: Ryan Gosling & Emma Stone]
A look in somebody's eyes
To light up the skies
To open the world and send it reeling
A voice that says, I'll be here
And you'll be alright

I don't care if I know
Just where I will go
'Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling
A rat-tat-tat on my heart

Think I want it to stay
City of stars
Are you shining just for me?

You never shined so brightly"

Mga gabing di namamalayang
Oras ay lumilipad
Mga sandaling lumalayag kung
San man tayo mapadpad
Bawat kilig na nadarama
Sa tuwing hawak ang 'yong kamay
Ito'y maling akala
Isang malaking sablay

[Chorus]
Pasensya ka na
Sa mga kathang isip kong ito
Wari'y dala lang ng pagmamahal sa iyo
Ako'y gigising na
Sa panaginip kong ito
At sa wakas ay kusang lalayo sa iyo (lalayo sa)

Gaano kabilis nag simula
Gano'n katulin nawala
Maaari ba tayong bumalik sa umpisa
Upang di na umasa ang pusong nagiisa

Wari'y dala lang pagmamahal sa iyo

Sumabay sa agos na isinulat ng tadhana
Minsan siya'y para sa iyo

Tatakbo papalayo
Kakalimutan ang lahat

Pero kahit saan man lumingon
Nasusulyapan ang kahapon
At sa aking bawat paghinga
Ikaw ang nasa isip ko sinta

Should've been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay away for the last time
Now you're standin' right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Tryna protect your feelings
You read in between the lines
Hope you're steady healing

Sometimes it's hard to face reality

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
Love and death are quite similar
How they come and go like cat burglars
Reality is kinda hard to face
Like actual facts is for flat-earthers
Rain's a requirement for flowers to grow
And pain's a requirement for power to grow
It's a miracle how one can change
From one what was just hours ago
Such is life though, it's just a cycle
The bigger picture and the smaller picture
Are exactly the same, it's macro, micro
Crack your atom and let your light glow
One day, you could be the king of pop
And the next one just be ""Wacko"" Michael
It's human nature, just like he told us
Let's face reality, crack the cycle

[Verse 4: Poo Bear]
Know it hurts to see the truth in your face
Circumstances bring you down to your knees
Go on and cry an ocean, but don't drown in it
Enough to put your heart at ease
Oh, don't lose your self esteem
I apologize, for being a man
It's way harder than what it seems

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Poo Bear]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh (reality)
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh (you might get mad at me, but I'll be at your bedside)
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Sometimes it's hard to face reality"

I'm way too good at goodbyes"
68,Take a Byte,Pop,"[Verse 1]
I'm not the kind of girl you take home to your mama now
I tell you no lies (I tell no lies)
Your code is programmed not to love me but you can't pretend
Oh, what a surprise
Maybe it's lust maybe it's love maybe it never ends
Ooh, say your goodbyes (say 'em now)
Play in my hair and nibble there all on my mocha skin
Yeah, just take a byte

[Chorus]
Take a byte (just take a byte)
Help yourself (help yourself)
It's alright (it's alright)
I won't tell (it feels so good when you nibble on it)
Take a byte (just take a byte)
Help yourself (you look so good just help yourself)
Don't think twice (don't think twice)
I won't tell

[Verse 2]
My random access memory wants you to come again
No, don't say goodbye (don't say goodbye)
I saw my therapist she thinks you are my magic sin
Oh, maybe she's right (maybe she's right)
Well I'll just lick an angel just to purify again
Ooh, angels are fun (they're so fun)
So dress me up I'll like it better if we both pretend
Yeah, make love 'till we're numb

[Chorus]
Take a byte (just take a byte)
Help yourself (just go ahead and help yourself)
It's alright (it's alright)
I won't tell (take a byte)
Take a byte (just take a byte)
Help yourself (you look so good just help yourself)
Don't think twice (don't think twice)
I won't tell
Take a byte (just take a byte)
Help yourself (help yourself)
It's alright (it's alright)
I won't tell
Take a byte (oh won't you just take a byte)
Help yourself (go on and help yourself)
It's alright
I won't tell

[Outro]
Just take a byte
You look so good just help yourself
It's alright
Take a little byte
Take a little byte

69,PYNK,Pop,"[Verse 1: Janelle Monáe]
Pynk, like the inside of your... baby
Pynk behind all of the doors... crazy

Pynk, like the paradise found
Pynk when you're blushing inside... baby
Pynk is the truth you can't hide... maybe
Pynk, like the folds of your brain...  crazy
Pynk as we all go insane

[Pre-Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
So, here we are in the car
Leavin' traces of us down the boulevard
I wanna fall through the stars
Getting lost in the dark is my favorite part
Let's count the ways we could make this last forever
Sunny, money, keep it funky
Touch your top and let it down

Yeah, somethin' like that
Owwww! Somethin' like that
Yeah, somethin' like that
'Cause boy, it's cool if you got blue
We got the pynk

Pynk, like the lips around you... maybe
Pynk, like the skin that's under... baby
Pynk, where it's deepest inside... crazy
Pynk beyond forest and thighs
Pynk, like the secrets you hide... maybe
Pynk, like the lid of your eye... baby
Pynk is where all of it starts... crazy
Pynk, like the holes of your heart

So, here we are in the car
Leavin' traces of us down the boulevard

Getting lost in the dark is my favorite part

71,The Nights,Pop,"[Verse 1]
Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Make memories we knew would never fade

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid

[Chorus]
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me

[Verse 2]
When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars
He said go venture far beyond these shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
When I was just a kid, I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid

[Chorus]
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me

[Outro]
These are the night that never die
My father told me
Hey, hey"

You told us we hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness

[Verse 1]
Young, black, wild and free
Naked on a limousine (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Riding through the hood real slow
I love it when we smell the trees (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I just wanna party hard
Sex in the swimming pool (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I don't need a lof of cash
I just wanna break the rules (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We don't need another ruler
All of my friends are kings (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I'm not American's nightmare
I'm the American dream (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Just let me live my life

[Chorus]
I want a crazy, classic, life
I want a crazy, classic, life
So if the world should end tonight
I had a crazy, classic, life

[Verse 2]
I don't need a diamond ring
I don't wanna waste my youth
I don't wanna live on my knees
I just have to tell the truth, baby
I don't wanna be left out
I don't wanna cheat on you
I just wanna find the guy
And I hope she loves me too

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We don't need another ruler
We don't need another fool (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I'm not American's nightmare
I'm the American cool (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Just let me live my life

[Chorus]
I want a crazy, classic, life
I want a crazy, classic, life
So if the world should end tonight
I had a crazy, classic, life

I want a crazy, classic, life
I want a crazy, classic, life
So if the world should end tonight
I had a crazy, classic, life
Crazy, classic, life

[Outro]
Handcuffed in a bando
White boy in his sandals
Police like a Rambo
Blow it out, blow it out like a candle, Sambo
Me and you was friends, but to them, we the opposite
The same mistake, I'm in jail, you on top of shit
You living life while I'm walking around moppin' shit
Tech kid, backpack, no, you a college kid
All I wanted was to break the rules like you
All I wanted was someone to love me too
But no matter where it was I always stood out
Black Waldo dancing with the thick brows
We was both running naked at the luau
We was both on shrooms praying face down, waist down
Remember when they told you I was too black for ya?
And now my black poppin' like a bra-strap on ya
I was kicked out, said I'm too loud
Kicked out, said I'm too proud
But all I really ever felt was stressed out
Kinda like my afro when it's pressed out"

74,Becky G & Natti Natasha - Sin Pijama (English Translation),Pop,"[Intro: Becky G, Natti Natasha]
[You are] alone, all alone in the bedroom
Search, search for my warmth, uoh-oh, no-no
You want a remedy for your pain
Nobody can feel you better than me, uoh-oh, no-no

[Pre-Chorus: Natti Natasha, Becky G]
So that your arousal won't go away
You know that I won't leave you stuck there
Calm down, I'm on my way, my love
Calm down, I want to be with you

[Chorus: Natti Natasha, Becky G]
If you call me
We'll go to your house
We'll stay in bed
Without pajamas, without pajamas

If you call me
We'll go to your house
We'll stay in bed
Without pajamas, without pajamas (yo, yo, yo)

[Vers 1: Becky G]
I'm going to tell my secrets to your pillow
Until then let's make a video call
Send me photos, little pics
Showing everything, everything at all
When I get there, we will mess up the bed

[Bridge: Becky G]
Baby, today we're not going to sleep (no)
Baby, today we're not going to sleep (uh-uh-uh)
I did not bring pajamas
Because I did not feel like it
Baby, today we're not going to sleep

Baby, today we're not going to sleep (no)

I did not bring pajamas
Because I did not feel like it
Baby, today we're not going to sleep

We'll go to your house
We'll stay in bed
Without pajamas, without pajamas

If you call me
We'll go to your house
We'll stay in bed
Without pajamas, without pajamas

[Vers 2: Natti Natasha]
Since this is not a theater, stop with the drama
Light the flame in me
The way I came to the world - that's my best pajama
Today there is a curfew
I'll be yours until morning
We get romantic
Without an autopilot
Let's ditch the rules, we're tripping on cannabis
I have always been a lady (a girl)
But I'm a bitch in bed

[Bridge: Natti Natasha, Becky G]
So come on on on on on on
Add some meat to what I've got cooking
Smash it all against my bonbon, bon-bon-bon
Let's lose control, that way both of us win

So come on on on on on on
Add some fire to what I've got cooking
Smash it all against my bonbon, bon-bon-bon
I wait for your call, come score a goal on me!

[Chorus: Natti Natasha, Becky G]
If you call me
We'll go to your house
We'll stay in bed
Without pajamas, without pajamas

If you call me
We'll go to your house
We'll smoke weed
Without pajamas, without pajamas

75,Hon Dansar Vidare I Livet,Pop,"[Vers 1: Noel Flike]
Nu står hon där med vitsippor i håret
Tänker på allt tomt
Allt kan bli förlåtet
Vissna, mörka perioder har genomsyrat året
Ser på gamla bilder
Brukade va sår
Men allting ja', allting ja', allting ja' va'
Försvann där o' då, yeah
Du likaså
Som man bäddar får man ligga, Ingen bädda när vi låg
Ligger lågt
Där i sängen var vi en, nu är vi ba' två
Från alfa till omega
Vi låg nog före hela
Stänger av varje gång någon spelar vår sång
Det här är överlevnad
Det är klart vi bytte skepnad
O' vi förlorade varann med nå'ra hundradelar
Inget jag vill ha tillbaks
Det är klart, Inget går i kras
Det är klart, det var du
Men förevigt var aldrig för oss, hjärtat
O' det vet vi nu

[Refräng: Ludwig Kronstrand]
Hon dansar vidare i livet
Jag sparkar backspeglar på vägen hem
Hon har allt för dyra kläder
Men hon var min

[Vers 2: Dante Lindhe]
Hon sa: kasta bort din blyertspenna, båda klär i bläck
Skriver du mitt namn så kan du få mig nu direkt
Alla vet att hon är vacker men finns mer, ett intellekt
Och ingen annan toppar vårat sex
Tårarna ska spruta inte rinna
Hon sa ligga inte luta
Så vi gråter inte längre nu i regnet på en julafton
Och alla våra smycken va' i plast
Men ändå vart det dyraste ja' haft
Så nästa gång vi ses
Kommer jag att minnas för oss båda
O' du vet, att ja' klipper bilar på din gata
Men du skrev
Kommer jag att hålla oss två i hemlighet
Och inget är försent
Så förneka oss föralltid
Kommer alltid va' din första
Kanske inte bästa men ja' hoppas på det största
Vi kanske ses igen när vi är vuxna
O' ligger som vi låg när vi va unga

[Refräng: Ludwig Kronstrand]
Hon dansar vidare i livet
Jag sparkar backspeglar på vägen hem
Hon har allt för dyra kläder
Men hon var min

[Vers 3: Ludwig Kronstrand]
Yo, Det va' så länge sen ja' såg dig, hur mår du nu?
Jag hörde att du träffa nån, o' att ni har kul
Inte för att snoka men ja' vet ju vad du gör
Alla här i staden gillar skvaller så jag hör
Lyssnar du på radio o' vad tycker du om oss?
Berätta nu om världen, var det bättre än du trott?
Stockholm är ju samma varför kommer du tillbaks?
Fan nu är vi gamla, vet du vad?
Vägen hit va' lång
Men inte som vi trott
Vi kollade på lägenheter där vi ville bo
Din mamma skicka hem mig, hon sa nu har ja' fått nog
Du släppte ut ditt hjärta genom fönstret som en bok
O' det va' blommor under kudden, båda drömde om varann
Det sprakar nog med mig, ja' vill minnas att vi brann
Du sa att vi förlora men mitt hjärta, vet du vad?
Vi båda har ju vunnit vi mår bra

[Refräng: ]
Hon dansar vidare i livet
Jag sparkar backspeglar på vägen hem
Hon har allt för dyra kläder
Men hon var min

[Outro: Ludwig Kronstrand]
För hon har blommor
Där i sitt hår
Tror hon har glömt nu
Det va' då
Men ja' ska minnas för oss två
Så bara gå"

I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh

Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look to me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flame
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer

Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain

But your eyes tell me you won't be there

I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna to tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

I want to know
Where I can go
When you're not around
And I'm feeling down
So won't you stay for a moment
So I can say
I, I need you so
Cause right now you know, that nothing here's new
And I'm obsessed with you
Then I fell to the ground
And you smiled at me and said

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna see you cry
You don't have to feel this emptiness
She said I love you till the day that I die
Well maybe she's right
Cause I don't wanna feel like I'm not me
And to be honest I don't even know why
I let myself get down in the first place

Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflowers still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down, do-do-down
Diggy dig down, du du du du
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes

You know you need to get yourself to sleep and dream
A dream of you and I
There's no need to keep an open eye
I promise I'm the one for you
Just let me hold you in these arms tonight
I’m lucky to be me and you can see it in my face
Back when I fucked my shit up too many times
Why would I let myself get down in the first place

Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflowers still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down, do-do-down
Diggy dig down, du du du

And so she sat me down and told me that I didn't have to cry
Said I didn't need to get down and feel empty inside
And told me that she love me for as long as she's alive
And well, maybe she's right, cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me
See, I honestly, don't even know why
I, I honestly don't even know why

Tryna keep my mind at bay

82,The Other Side,Pop,"[Verse 1: P.T. Barnum]
Right here, right now
I put the offer out
I don't want to chase you down
I know you see it
You run with me
And I can cut you free
Out of the drudgery and walls you keep in
So trade that typical for something colorful
And if it's crazy, live a little crazy
You can play it sensible, a king of conventional
Or you can risk it all and see

[Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
Don't you wanna get away from the same old part you gotta play
'Cause I got what you need
So come with me and take the ride
It'll take you to the other side
'Cause you can do like you do
Or you can do like me
Stay in the cage, or you'll finally take the key
Oh, damn! Suddenly you're free to fly
It'll take you to the other side

[Verse 2: Phillip Carlyle]
Okay, my friend, you want to cut me in
Well I hate to tell you, but it just won't happen
So thanks, but no
I think I'm good to go
'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in
Now I admire you, and that whole show you do
You're onto something, really it's something
But I live among the swells, and we don't pick up peanut shells
I'll have to leave that up to you

[Chorus: Phillip Carlyle]
Don't you know that I'm okay with this uptown part I get to play
'Cause I got what I need and I don't want to take the ride
I don't need to see the other side
So go and do like you do
I'm good to do like me
Ain't in a cage, so I don't need to take the key
Oh, damn! Can't you see I'm doing fine
I don't need to see the other side

[Verse 3: P.T. Barnum]
Now is this really how you like to spend your days?
Whiskey and misery, and parties and plays

[Phillip Carlyle]
If I were mixed up with you, I'd be the talk of the town
Disgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns

[P.T. Barnum]
But you would finally live a little, finally laugh a little
Just let me give you the freedom to dream and it'll
Wake you up and cure your aching
Take your walls and start 'em breaking
Now that's a deal that seems worth taking
But I guess I'll leave that up to you

[Bridge: Phillip Carlyle]
Well it's intriguing, but to go would cost me greatly
So what percentage of the show would I be taking?

[P.T. Barnum]
Fair enough, you'd want a piece of all the action
I'd give you seven, we could shake and make it happen

[Phillip Carlyle]
I wasn't born this morning, eighteen would be just fine

[P.T. Barnum]
Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime

[Phillip Carlyle]
Fifteen

[P.T. Barnum]
I'd do eight

[Phillip Carlyle]
Twelve

[P.T. Barnum]
Maybe nine

[Phillip Carlyle]
Ten

[Chorus: Both]
Don't you wanna get away to a whole new part you're gonna play
'Cause I got what you need, so come with me and take the ride
To the other side
So if you do like I do
So if you do like me
Forget the cage, 'cause we know how to make the key
Oh, damn! Suddenly we're free to fly
We're going to the other side
So if you do like I do
(To the other side)
So if you do like me
(We're going to the other side)
'Cause if we do we're going to the other side
We're going to the other side"

I think I, I think I finally
Found a way to forgive myself
From mistakes I made in my past
I think that's the first step, right?
You agree?

[Verse]
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts, break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts, break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot

In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot

86,Billie Jean,Pop,"[1st Verse]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

[2nd Verse]
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Bridge]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts""
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth""

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

[3rd Verse]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (hoo)

[4th Verse]
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (oh no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

[Bridge]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts""
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
She says she is the one
She says I am the one

[Verse 1]
I’m living in that 21st Century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the power
(21st-Century schizoid man)
The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open
We ain’t got nothing to lose, motherfucker we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I’ll see you in the morning
Huh? I’ll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

[Hook]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the power
Till then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-Century schizoid man)

[Verse 2]
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my asshole
I’m an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he’s so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn’t open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I’m fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinking

[Hook]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the powder
Till then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-Century schizoid man)

[Verse 3]
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation
Well that’s a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, god damn it I’m killing this shit
I know damn well y’all feeling this shit
I don’t need your pussy, bitch, I’m on my own dick
I ain’t gotta power trip, who you going home with?
How 'Ye doing? I’m surviving
I was drinking earlier, now I’m driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding?
I got the power to make your life so exciting

[Outro: Kanye West & Dwele]
Now this will be a beautiful death
I’m jumping out the window, I’m letting everything go
I’m letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
I’m jumping out the window, I’m letting everything go
I’m letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
I’m jumping out the window, I’m letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty

Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold
Oh, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Cigarettes in the ashtray
Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you’d end up with my last name
But that changed
And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while
I start texting
Write a paragraph
But then I delete the message
Think 'bout you like a past time
I could cry you a river
Get you baptised or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study Art
Love is just a tool
To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone
And we're walking in the dark

[Chorus: Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen]
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Bout the way life plays out

I take one step away
And I find myself coming back
To you

Except the fact that I am yours

Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus 1]
'Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18

Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life

Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have (Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)

Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe, mmm
I need a lover to trust, tell me you're on my side
Are you down for the ride?
It's not easy for someone to catch my eye
But I've been waitin' for you for my whole damn life
For my whole lifetime

Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it (you ain't with it)

So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies

[Verse 2: Normani]
I've been so into your mystery
Is it because of our history?
Are you into me?
When it feels so good, but it's bad for you
Can't say I don't want it 'cause I know I do
Come on over, I need your company
Cravin' that synergy

I don't know when this tornado hit
You're from the east coast, so let's both call it
A hurricane
A hericane
Pacin' through the, the back of my mind
Maybe you've been a storm all this time
A hurricane
A hericane

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop all this sin
Be born again
If you want to, if you want to

[Chorus]
'Cause our home's a wreck, look at this mess
You blame it on disobedience
But I think it's time, time you realized
You're the one in the wrong

[Verse 2]
Oklahoma, this time of year
California, it's different out here
No hericane
No hericane
I'm not runnin' from all my pain
But it can't go, go without sayin'
No hericane
No hericane

Stop all this sin
Start over again
If you want to, if you want to

'Cause our home's a wreck, look at this mess
You blame it on disobedience
But I think it's time, time you realized
You're the one in the wrong
Caught in the midst of your insecure winds
Breakin' us down and wearin' us thin
But I love you still, I always will
But you're the one in the wrong

I know your heart hurts the most at 3 AM
I know he left before you could even know him
I've done my best to carry all this weight
I love you still, I always will, but this needs to change

You blame it on disobedience

101,Super Far,Pop,"[Verse 1]
Up all night on my mind got me thinking
Wanna stay, can you give me a reason?
I don't think so, I don't think so
I'm in love with someone, but I'm not sure
She can love someone back the way they love her
I don't think so, I don't think so

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't be mean, if you wanna go
You can leave and leave my heart alone

[Chorus]
Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it

[Verse 2]
Give it time, c'mon babe, it's been ten months
You should know, do you know, know what you want?
I don't think so, I don't think so
Make it work, know it hurts, but I'll go there
Do the same, can you show me that you care?
God, I hope so, but I don't think so

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't be mean, if you're here for good
I'm gonna need a little more from you

Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it
All my friends keep saying that I'm way too good to you
But my heart is so invested, I don't wanna face the truth
I'm not happy, and you know it, and you still don't even try
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it

Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home

I'm not happy, and you know it, and you still don't even try
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it"
102,River,Pop,"[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run"
103,Burn,Pop,"[ELIZA]
I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them
I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine

Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive?
She said

“Be careful with that one, love
He will do what it takes to survive.”

You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
You built cathedrals
I’m re-reading the letters you wrote me
I’m searching and scanning for answers
In every line
For some kind of sign
And when you were mine
The world seemed to

Burn
Burn

You published the letters she wrote you
You told the whole world how you brought
This girl into our bed
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you’d done?
She said
“You have married an Icarus
He has flown too close to the sun.”

You and your words, obsessed with your legacy...
Your sentences border on senseless
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you

You, you, you…

I’m erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder how Eliza
Reacted when you broke her heart
You have torn it all apart
I am watching it
Burn
Watching it burn
The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed
They don’t get to know what I said
I’m burning the memories
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed
You sleep in your office instead
With only the memories
Of when you were mine
I hope that you burn"

Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it—my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but…

You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt yet
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?

What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you

Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Could have made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

Laying next to you, I got a flight in the morning
Got me questioning what I think is important
I can't even lie, think of you when I'm with her
Look me in my eye, tell me that you feel different
Drove two hours just to stay the night with you
Haven't seen you in a year, but I still get you
Hurts to see you laugh 'cause I know I'll fucking miss that
How could I forget that?

Times that we have, so wild, can't forget that

Life out in Cali has been great, I'm committed
You the only thing that makes me wish things were different
I might fly you out, get your ass on a one-way
If I had it my way...

You're so money, baby, you ain't even have to try
Now I'm runnin' with you 'round East Lansing
Tito's in your dorm, we're dancing
It's a quarter after three
Sayin' everything we mean

For a moment, I was feeling like I had you
Didn't wanna leave, I had to
It's a quarter after three
Saying everything we mean"

Melebur sifat kakuku

Hal bodoh jadi lucu
Obrolan tak perlu kala itu
Oh tersalurkan aliran syaraf buntu

Berdansa sore hariku
Sejiwa alam dan duniamu
Melebur sifat kakuku
Rasanya tak cukup waktu
Terlalu cepat berlalu
Soreku nyaman denganmu

Menarilah, menarilah
Menarilah denganku

Berputar-putar denganku

Yaşadık be tamam
Anladıysak ne gam
Bir sofrada bin saf tutulmuş
Görmüyorsan devam

Ağlarım gülerim
Aynı tas ve hamam
Adamım, kaygan kanun bu
Düşerim uyamam

Kalmasın bak elinde
Gönül bu yerme yerinme
Ve dünya bir çölse, durma
Seraba su getir

[Hook]
öyle kolaysa gel başımdan
Kaldır at sevdanı
Dertli saz bu boşa çalınmaz
çaldığın reva mı

öyle kolaysa gel başımdan
Kaldır at sevdanı
Dertli sazdım boşa çalınmazdım
çaldığın reva mı

Satmam!
Bu dert benim hem ağam hem paşam!
öğrenirim onunla kendimi
Direnenler yaşar

Kalmasın bak elinde

I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus 1: Ed Sheeran]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2: Andrea Bocelli]
Sei la mia donna
La forza delle onde del mare
Cogli i miei sogni e i miei segreti molto di più
Spero che un giorno, l'amore che ci ha accompagnato
Diventi casa, la mia famiglia, diventi noi
E siamo sempre bambini ma
Nulla è impossibile
Stavolta non ti lascerò
Mi baci piano ed io, torno ad esistere
E nel tuo sguardo crescerò

[Chorus 2: Andrea Bocelli]
Ballo con te, nell'oscurità
Stretti forte poi, a piedi nudi noi
Dentro la nostra musica
Ti ho guardato ridere e sussurrando ho detto
Tu stasera, vedi sei perfetta per me

[Chorus 3: Ed Sheeran & Andrea Bocelli]
Ballo con te, nell'oscurità
Stretti forte poi, a piedi nudi noi
Dentro la nostra musica
Ho creduto sempre in noi
Perchè sei un angelo e io ti ho aspettato
Quanto ti ho aspettato
Perché tu stasera, sei perfetta per me"

Yeah, I'd rather be a lover than a fighter (fighter)
'Cause all my life, I've been fighting
Never felt a feeling of comfort
All this time, I've been hiding
And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah
I'm so used to sharing
Love only left me alone
But I'm at one with the silence

[Chorus]
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

I've been quiet for too long
I've been quiet for too long

Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long

[Verse 2]
I'm in need of a savior, but I'm not asking for favors
My whole life, I've felt like a burden
I think too much, and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence

[Chorus]
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (Goddamn)

For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (Goddamn)
They mad they still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (Goddamn)

Put one up in the sky

Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
No matter how hard they try, whoo!
We never gonna die

That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're alright

A melody I start but can't complete

Listen
To the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release

Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believin' you

You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own
My own"

127,You'll Be Back,Pop,"[Verse 1: KING GEORGE]
You say
The price of my love’s not a price that you’re willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you’re making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I’m your man
You’ll be back, soon you’ll see
You’ll remember you belong to me
You’ll be back, time will tell
You’ll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise, empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love!

[Chorus: KING GEORGE ]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da…

[Verse 2: KING GEORGE]
You say our love is draining and you can’t go on
You’ll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don’t change the subject
Cuz you’re my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever…

[Verse 3: KING GEORGE]
You’ll be back like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love, for your praise
And I’ll love you till my dying days
When you’re gone, I’ll go mad
So don’t throw away this thing we had
Cuz when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love

[Chorus: KING GEORGE ]
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat—
Everybody!

Got the window down, top, blowin' la
Got the hazards on, only doin' five

You can catch me, Rih, in the new La Ferrar'
And the truck behind me got arms
Yeah, longer than LeBron
Just waitin' for my thumb like The Fonz
Woo! This beat tastes like lunch
But it's runnin' from veneers and it's runnin' from the fronts
But everyday, hey, wasn't lemonade
I was afraid, once a nigga graduate
Would I be okay?
So I prayed and I played
It's Rihanna, nigga

Warp speed, Doctor Spock couldn't chase, nigga

129,Feel It Still,Pop,"[Verse 1]
Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?

[Chorus 1]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?

Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Verse 3]
We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come down
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
It's time to give a little to the kids in the middle
But, oh until it falls
Won't bother me

Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?

Might be over now, but I feel it still

130,I'd Rather Be Me,Pop,"[JANIS]
So your best friend screwed you over
Acted nice when she’s not nice
Well, I have some advice
‘Cause it’s happened to me. Twice
Here’s my secret strategy
It always works because
The world doesn’t end
It just feels like it does

So raise your right finger
And solemnly swear
""Whatever they say about me
I don’t care!""

I won’t twist in knots to join your game
I will say, ""you make me mad.""
And if you treat me bad
I’ll say “you’re bad”

And if I eat alone from this moment on
That’s just what I’ll do
‘Cause I’d rather be me, I’d rather be me
I’d rather be me than be with you

We’re supposed to all be ladies
And be nurturing and care
Is that really fair?
Boys get to fight, we have to share
Here’s the way that turns out
We always understand
How to slap someone down
With our underhand

So here’s my right finger
To how girls should behave
'Cause sometimes what’s meant to break you
Makes you brave

So I will not act all innocent
I won’t fake apologize
Let’s just fight and then make up
Not tell these lies

Let’s call our damage even
Clean the slate till it's like new
It’s a new life for me
Where I’d rather be me
I’d rather be me
Than be with you

[JANIS]
I'll say, ""NO!""

[FEMALE STUDENTS]
NO!

[JANIS]
I’ll say, ""knock it off, with your notes and your rules and your games.""
And those sycophants who follow you
I’ll remember all their names

And when they drag you down
Like they inevitably do
I will not laugh along with them and approve their palace coup, ‘cause that’s not me

Wish I could say these words to you beside a fireplace now
Hold up, just hold up baby, I ain't no filthy player

Hope one day the person I give my ring to is you

Get it on my ride, get on my ride, sit back and hold on tight
Feeling my vibe, feeling my vibe, I see you in my sight
If you the sun, then I hope to be the planets surrounding you
Taking selfies with the satellites while I'm with you
Romeo and Juliet but we don't have to split apart
Gonna hit the bulls eye anyway, believe and throw the dart
I cross the amazon, let me bring you back to a brand new journey
Started from day one, already I'm packed, leave it all down to me
Girl, we gon', we gon', we gon' gon' reach the paradise
We are, we know, for you, yeah I will sacrifice
Girl, we gon', we gon', we gon' gon' reach the paradise

133,Whatever It Takes,Pop,"[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system; a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes"

I saw the sun begin to dim
And felt that winter wind
Blow cold
A man learns who is there for him
When the glitter fades and the walls won't hold
'Cause from then, rubble
What remains
Can only be what's true
If all was lost
There's more I gained
'Cause it led me back
To you

[Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
From now on
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights
From now on
What's waited till tomorrow starts tonight
Tonight
Let this promise in me start
Like an anthem in my heart
From now on
From now on

[Verse 2: P.T. Barnum]
I drank champagne with kings and queens
The politicians praised my name
But those are someone else's dreams
The pitfalls of the man I became
For years and years
I chased their cheers
The crazy speed of always needing more
But when I stop
And see you here
I remember who all this was for

[Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
And from now on
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights

Sometimes I'm broke

Is there a code?
Can we make it better?

Tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how 'cause I believe in something

After the dust

Over the riots, above all the noise
Through all the worry, I still hear your voice

So, tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how ‘cause I believe in something

Tell me when the light goes down
That even in the dark we will find a way out
Tell me now 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us

We used to be kids living just for kicks
In cinema seats, learning how to kiss
Running through streets that were painted gold
We never believed we'd grow up like this

So tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us
Tell me when the light goes down
That even in the dark we can find a way out
Tell me now 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us
I believe in something

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh, (any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo. Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go.) Will not let you go

No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

138,Pray (Remix),Pop,"[Verse 1: Logic]
They never knew my struggle
Rose above the rubble
Rather live inside they bubble
Than go through the trouble
Of having they double-double vision corrected
They just neglect it and—
I've been thinkin' lately
Will the Devil take me?
Or will God protect me?
I know I ain't perfect, but you should respect me
They don't want me happy
They don't want to let me live

[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
I'm young and I'm foolish, I made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naïve
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray

[Verse 3: Logic]
I am me
I'm a man, I'm a sinner
But understand, aren't we all?
So when it comes to passin' judgements
I don't think that you're the one to make the call
Heaven want to cast me out for being me
I know there's others like me that'll break the fall
I know you hater motherfuckers just can't relate at all
If I'm the first one to the line, that's fine, I'll take it all
Well Logic, He gon' let 'em know
I ain't perfect, but I'm worth it
I'm alive, I deserve it
I been praying, I ain't playin'
I don't think you hear the words that I'm sayin'
I don't think you know the weight on my shoulders
That gets heavier as I get older
Callin' anybody, callin' anybody
""Can you hear me?""
I pray that you hear me
I pray that you hear me

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Maybe I'll pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna...

[Bridge: Sam Smith]
Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end
Oh, won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end

Oh, I'm gonna pray
I'm gonna pray
I'm gonna pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray

No, but I'm gonna pray"

Je viens d'ailleurs, j'apprends sur l'terrain

Pourquoi ma musique transperce les cœurs?
Parce que la vie ne nous a pas fait d'fleur

I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much

You were throwing up

For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over

I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Bridge]
I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Outro]
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"
141,We Are Young,Pop,"[Verse 1: Nate Ruess]
Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things, the holes in my apologies
You know I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

[Hook: Nate Ruess]
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter

Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a cup
Cause I found someone to carry me home

142,You Will Be Found,Pop,"[EVAN]
Have you ever felt like nobody was there?
Have you ever felt forgotten in the middle of nowhere?
Have you ever felt like you could disappear?
Like you could fall, and no one would hear?

(spoken)
But see, see the thing is when I looked up Connor was there
That was the gift he gave me, to show me that I wasn't alone
To show me that I mattered Everybody does
That's the gift that he gave all of usI just wish, I wish I could have given that to him...

(sung)
Well, let that lonely feeling wash away
Maybe there’s a reason to believe you’ll be okay
‘Cause when you don’t feel strong enough to stand
You can reach, reach out your hand

And oh, someone will coming running
And I know, they’ll take you home

Even when the dark comes crashing through
When you need a friend to carry you
And when you’re broken on the ground
You will be found

So let the sun come streaming in
'Cause you’ll reach up and you’ll rise again
Lift your head and look around
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found

Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, ""Keep our business on the low-low""
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me

I only call you when it's half past five

I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple

And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

Every day I just pray
Every move I make is right
Where I go
Who I know

Will I be alone on Saturday night

And I worry
What if I stand out one bit
I worry
What can I possibly do
To fit in
Am I (X9)
The perfect
Clothes

The perfect
Skin

Both my folks
Total jokes
All they do is chew my ass (blah blah blah blah)
They should just be glad I make it to class

If I blow my SATs
I worry
What can I possibly do

Wondering what the world will say
Make a plan

I go crazy
Nobody cares what it does to me

And it's crazy
I would go out of my mind

To be in it
In is it
What comes close to that
Until you've been in
You ain't where it's at
Cause when you're out
Well
Life is hell
You can never win
There's no doubt
That life just doesn't begin
Until you're

And someday
If I don't stand out one bit
Oh someday
I may be normal enough
To fit in
Cause life just doesn’t begin
Doesn’t begin (doesn’t begin)
Doesn’t begin (doesn’t begin)

145,Africa,Pop,"[Verse 1: David Paich]
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

[Verse 2: David Paich]
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

[Bridge]
Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

148,Your Reality,Pop,"[Verse 1]
Every day, I imagine a future where I can be with you
In my hand is a pen that will write a poem of me and you
The ink flows down into a dark puddle
Just move your hand - write the way into his heart!
But in this world of infinite choices
What will it take just to find that special day?
What will it take just to find that special day?

[Verse 2]
Have I found everybody a fun assignment to do today?
When you're here, everything that we do is fun for them anyway
When I can't even read my own feelings
What good are words when a smile says it all?
And if this world won't write me an ending
What will it take just for me to have it all?

[Verse 3]
Does my pen only write bitter words for those who are dear to me?
Is it love if I take you, or is it love if I set you free?
The ink flows down into a dark puddle
How can I write love into reality?
If I can't hear the sound of your heartbeat
What do you call love in your reality?
And in your reality, if I don't know how to love you
I'll leave you be"

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

I'm more concerned with commas
Than keeping up with you
Keep that away from me
I put the Heisman up to bad energy
No empathy, especially when the kid off Hennessy
Fake friends to me make my mood go south like Tennessee
Make the fool come out like, ""Who is he?""

Wala na ngang iba
Sa 'king puso'y tunay kang nag-iisa

'Di ko nais na mawalay ka
Kahit sandali sa aking piling
Kahit buksan pa ang dibdib ko
Matatagpua'y larawan mo

(Repeat Chorus)
Kahit buksan pa ang dibdib ko
Matatagpua'y larawan mo

Candy paint with the white on top
Lambo doors are the oo-op drop

Hundred thousand dollars on the table top
Half price my whip, same price my watch

156,Home,Pop,"[Chorus: Sam Harris & Bebe Rexha]
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Look, I didn't power through the struggle
Just to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witnessed, after all of these decisions
All these miles, feet, inches
They can't add up to the distance
That I have been through, just to get to
A place where even if there's no closure, I'm still safe
I still ache from trying to keep pace
Somebody give me a sign, I'm starting to lose faith

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Harris & Machine Gun Kelly]
Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair
I'm trying to find

[Chorus: Sam Harris + Bebe Rexha & Machine Gun Kelly]
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
It's been a long time coming
Someone take me

[Post-Chorus: Sam Harris & Bebe Rexha]
Home, ho-o-o-o-me
Home, home
Someone take me
Home, ho-o-o-o-me
Home, home

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Look, I've been through so much pain
And it's hard to maintain, any smile on my face
'Cause there's madness on my brain
So I gotta make it back, but my home ain't on the map
Gotta follow what I'm feeling to discover where it's at
I need the (memory)
In case this fate is forever, just to be sure these last days are better
And if I have any (enemies)
To give me the strength to look the devil in the face and make it home safe

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Harris & Machine Gun Kelly]
Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair
I'm trying to find

[Chorus: Sam Harris + Bebe Rexha]
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me

[Bridge: Bebe Rexha + Sam Harris]
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone

[Post-Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly, Sam Harris & Bebe Rexha]
Someone take me
Home, ho-o-o-o-me
Take me home
Home, home (take me home)
Someone take me
Home, ho-o-o-o-me (someone, someone)
Nothing here feels like home
Home, home

157,Come Alive,Pop,"[Verse 1: P.T. Barnum]
You stumble through your days
Got your head hung low
Your skies' a shade of grey
Like a zombie in a maze
You're asleep inside
But you can shake awake

[Pre-Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
'Cause you're just a dead man walking
Thinking that's your only option
But you can flip the switch and brighten up your darkest day
Sun is up and the color's blinding
Take the world and redefine it
Leave behind your narrow mind
You'll never be the same

[Pre-Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
Come alive, come alive
Go and light your light
Let it burn so bright
Reaching up
To the sky
And it's open wide
You're electrified

When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And you know you can't go back again
To the world that you were living in
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
So, come alive!

[Verse 2: P.T. Barnum]
I see it in your eyes
You believe that lie
That you need to hide your face
Afraid to step outside
So you lock the door
But don't you stay that way

No more living in those shadows
You and me, we know how that goes

[Lord of Leeds]
'Cause once you see it, oh you'll never, never be the same

Bottle up but keep on shining

[All]
You can prove there's more to you

[P.T. Barnum]
You cannot be afraid

Come alive, come alive
Go and light your light
Let it burn so bright
Reaching up
To the sky

You're electrified

All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh

And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone

It could change, but this feels like, like the calm before the storm
Not that I don't wanna try, but I've been here before
Friends in town, phone's at home, I tell myself it's fine
Can't remember how you taste, slept alone too many nights

Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time

Half my clothes are at your house, and I don't want them back

164,Take Me to Church,Pop,"[Produced by Hozier and Rob Kirwan]

[Video directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson]

[Verse 1: Hozier]
My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me ""worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus: Hozier]
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus: Hozier]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Chorus: Hozier]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 2: Hozier]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus: Hozier]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Chorus: Hozier]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Bridge: Hozier]
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus: Hozier]
Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus: Hozier]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death

Take me to church

Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late, and he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice

Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope nope, y'all can't copy
Yup, Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushin'
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give it to the people, spread it across the country

[Hook: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Tell me go up, gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said…

[Hook: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Interlude]
And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up
Oh, oh, oh, oh…

[Bridge: Macklemore and Ray Dalton]
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey-ee ay-ee ay-ee ay ay-ee ay-ee, hey
And all my people say
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey-ee ay-ee ay-ee ay ay-ee ay-ee, hey
And all my people say

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Hook: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Outro *Music Video Ending*]
Let the night come, before the fight's won
Some might run against the test
But those that triumph embrace the fight 'cause
The fear is there to prove that courage exists
Now let the night come, before the fight's won
And some might run against the test
But those that triumph embrace the fight 'cause
The fear is there to prove that courage exists"

[Video by Dave Jensen and Tavic]

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

[Hook]
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
And you let her go
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
When you let her go
Whoa

[Hook]
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go..."

I had a few, got drunk on you and now I’m wasted
And when I sleep I’m gonna dream of how you

If you go out tonight, I’m going out ‘cause I know you’re persuasive
You got that something, I got me an appetite; now I can taste it

171,Riptide,Pop,"[Verse 1]

I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

I got a lump in my throat cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Oh, and they come unstuck

I love you when you're singing that song and

I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay

Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

[Post-Chorus 1]
The way that Gucci look on you, amazing
But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
You're saying you're the one for me, I need to face it

[Verse 1]
Started when we were younger
Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mum found out
Guess that we just really had the thunder
Ain't nobody else said I'd be under
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
No, no, no

You came a little closer, now you're shaking

Don't believe the lies they feed you
Stop and stare like a sculpture
Painted in your colors

Beautiful, beautiful night right now
Beautiful, beautiful by my side right now

I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind (oh)

I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you thinking about it, yeah
Do I gotta convince you?
That you shouldn't fall asleep
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

[Chorus]
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you

Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 1]
Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'mma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 2]
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride?
No, they used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car

Holly like a boulevard

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told ""a tight dress is what makes you a whore""
If ""I love you"" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
Idontwannabeyouanymore

[Verse 2]
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told ""a tight dress is what makes you a whore""
If ""I love you"" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you...
Anymore"

Not tryna be cool
Just tryna be in this

181,Gotta Go My Own Way,Pop,"[Gabriella]
I gotta say what's on my mind
Something about us doesn't seem right these days
Life keeps getting in the way
Whenever we try, somehow the plan
Is always rearranged

It's so hard to say
But I've gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay...

I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way

Don't wanna leave it all behind
But I get my hopes up
And I watch them fall every time
Another color turns to grey
And it's just too hard to watch it all
Slowly fade away
I'm leaving today cause I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay...

I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way

[Troy]
What about us?
What about everything we've been through?

[Gabriella]
What about trust?

[Troy]
You know I never wanted to hurt you

[Gabriella]
And what about me?

[Troy]
What am I supposed to do?

[Gabriella]
I gotta leave but

[Both]
I'll miss you

[Gabriella (Troy)]
So I've got to move on and be who I am
(Why do you have to go?)
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand
(I'm trying to understand)
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
(I want you to stay)
I gotta go my own way

I've got to move on and be who I am
(What about us?)
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand
(I'm trying to understand)
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
I gotta go my own way
I gotta go my own way"

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Don't be afraid to stand alone
Don't be afraid to stand outside the door alone
I know it's hard away from home
And it ain't easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin' to your significant other all night long

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

[Verse 2: Poo Bear]
Should've been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time
Now you're standin' right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Try to protect your feelings
You read in between the lines
Hope your heart has started healing

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality"

I'm from the east side of America
Where we choose pride over character
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

[Refrain]
And don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say, when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Where we're united under our indifference

And I'm from the east side of America
Where we desensitize by hysteria

And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart

From your roommate back in Boulder

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

Moved to the city in a broke-down car

It’s out there if you look hard enough, enough, enough

Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall
But watching you stand alone?
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years

Она закрыла инстаграм от меня
Чтоб я не смог за ней следить никогда
И удалила свой ВК навсегда
Теперь не знаю, как мне жить
А, мне предъявил её пацан (бла-бла-бла)
Чтоб я не смел за ней ходить никуда
Бабок очень много у его отца (как и связей)
А, а сам он, в общем-то, мудак (да)

[Припев]
Ха-ха, бэйби
К твоим ногам я сыпал роз лепестки
Мои глаза роняли слёзы тоски
Но для тебя я слишком прост был, прости
Ха-ха, бэйби
К твоим ногам я сыпал роз лепестки
А оказалось, ты ебёшь мне мозги
Пока тебя ебёт богатый дрозд из Москвы

[Куплет 2]
Полторашка за полторашкой
Больно так же, но уже не страшно
Я пойду и набью ему ебало
Чтобы ты силу моей любви понимала
Ха-ха, когда меня посадят
В тюрьму из-за папиных связей
Старая мама будет горько плакать, глядя
На остатки роз в дешёвой стеклянной вазе

[Припев]
Ха-ха, бэйби
К твоим ногам я сыпал роз лепестки
Мои глаза роняли слёзы тоски (кап-кап)

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
""I'll remember,"" you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Verse 2]
I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

[Chorus]
Now you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Verse 3]
I took a plane to my home town
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said tell us how to make it cause we're getting real impatient
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

[Chorus]
You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs"

Little town, it's a quiet village
Every day like the one before
Little town, full of little people
Waking up to say

[ENSEMBLE]
Bonjour! Bonjour!
Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!

[BELLE]
There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor, provincial town

[MONSIEUR JEAN, spoken]
Good Morning, Belle!

[BELLE, spoken]
Good morning, Monsieur Jean
Have you lost something again?

[MONSIEUR JEAN, spoken]
Well, I believe I have
Problem is, I've—I can't remember what
Oh well, I'm sure it'll come to me
Where are you off to?

[BELLE]
To return this book to Père Robert
It's about two lovers in fair Verona

[MONSIEUR JEAN, spoken]
Sounds boring

[ENSEMBLE]
Look there she goes, that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?
Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

Bonjour! Good day! How is your family?
Bonjour! Good day! How is your wife?
I need six eggs! That's too expensive!

[BELLE]
There must be more than this provincial life!

[PERE ROBERT, spoken]
Ahh, if it isn't the only bookworm in town!
So, where did you run off to this week?

[BELLE, spoken]
Two cities in Northern Italy
I didn't want to come back
Have you got any new places to go?

[PERE ROBERT, spoken]
I'm afraid not...
But you may re-read any of the old ones that you'd like

[BELLE, spoken]
Your library makes our small corner of the world feel big

[PERE ROBERT, spoken]
Bon voyage!

[ENSEMBLE]
Look there she goes, the girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

[BELLE]
Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because—you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til Chapter Three!

[ENSEMBLE]
Now it's no wonder that her name means ""Beauty""
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very diff'rent from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle!

[GASTON, spoken]
Look at her, LeFou—my future wife
Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village
That makes her the best

[LEFOU, spoken]
But she's so... well-read!
And you're so... athletically inclined

[GASTON, spoken]
Yes... But ever since the war, I've felt like I've been missing something. And she's the only girl that gives me that sense of—

[LEFOU, spoken]
Mmm... je ne sais quoi?

[GASTON, spoken]
I don't know what that means

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town, there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute!
Be still, my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!

A most peculiar mademoiselle!

It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in
'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
