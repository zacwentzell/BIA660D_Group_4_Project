2,A Million Dreams,Pop,"[YOUNG P.T.]
I close my eyes and I can see
The world that's waiting up for me
That I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no one's been before
But it feels like home

They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I don't care, so call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design

'Cause every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled
With things from far away
The special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile
On a rainy day

They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy
Runaway to a world that we design

[P.T. BARNUM]
Every night I lie  in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

[CHARITY BARNUM, with P.T. BARNUM]
However big, however small
Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
You may be right, you may be wrong
But say that you'll bring me along
To the world you see
To the world I close my eyes to see
I close my eyes to see

Every night I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
A million dreams, a million dreams
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

For the world we're gonna make"
3,Rewrite the Stars,Pop,"[Verse 1: Phillip Carlyle]
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep saying our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away
And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That you're my destiny?

[Chorus 1: Phillip Carlyle]
What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours
Tonight

[Verse 2: Anne Wheeler]
You think it's easy
You think I don't want to run to you
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wondering why
Because we're able to be
Just you and me
Within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

[Chorus 2: Anne Wheeler]
No one can rewrite the stars
How can you say you'll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
It's not up to you, it's not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be
How can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours
Tonight

[Post Chorus: Both, Anne Wheeler, Phillip Carlyle]
All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
It's not impossible
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible

[Chorus 3: Phillip Carlyle and Anne Wheeler]
How do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine?
Nothing can keep us apart
Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
And why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changing the world to be ours

[Outro: Anne Wheeler]
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you
We're bound to break and
My hands are tied"

5,The Middle,Pop,"[Verse 1: Maren Morris]
Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

[Pre-Chorus: Maren Morris]
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

[Verse 2: Maren Morris]
Ohh, take a step
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still running, dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess? Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

[Pre-Chorus: Maren Morris]
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
I can't just let you go

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

[Bridge: Maren Morris]
Looking at you, I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless of my objection
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin
Just come over, pull me in, just

[Chorus: Maren Morris]
Oh, baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle, no no
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh yeah, I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh, in the middle
Baby-y-y, why don't you just meet me in the middle, baby?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, middle?
In the middle, middle"
6,Be Careful,Pop,"[Intro]
Yeah
Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly‚ÄîTommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

[Bridge]
Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

[Verse 2]
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this love's got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me"

Look, I just want to break up all your shit, call your mama phone
Let her know that she raised a bitch, then dial tone, click
And fuck your little fake ass friends
Come around actin' like they my bros
I seen y'all little group texts
Where you all like to brag about your hoes
And you can tell your little bitch
I screenshotted all her naked pics
Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man?
Wake up and see your boobs on the 'Gram?
Lil' bitch, I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus
I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers
Smash your TV from Best Buy
You gon' turn me into into Left Eye
I don't wanna hear 'bout invasion of privacy
I had a feeling, it turns out you lie to me
I'm holdin' back everything that's inside of me
How you all fuckin' with bitches that follow me?

Serve it to you like, ""Here you go, nigga, bon app√©tit""
Look did you give it to her raw? You love her or nah?
You risk your whole home for a hoe from the bar?
You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches
You don't even cheat with no badder bitches
This shit is eatin' me, you sleepin' peacefully
Gettin' more mad at you, thinkin' 'bout stabbin' you
Don't even know that you this close to dyin'
You gon' wake up like, ""Why you got an attitude?""

I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002
We were only eleven
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing ""love is forever and ever""
Well, I guess that was true

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs

Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to 2002

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it

I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone

It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow

She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home

Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time

Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Just gotta tell you how I feel, look

Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, I can't look away, I just gotta say

Swear to God I'm down if you're down all you gotta say is right
Girl anything I can do just to make you feel alright

Running circles 'round my mind
Even when it's rainy all you ever do is shine
You on fire, you a star just like Mariah

You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart

When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, no one could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don‚Äôt need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really want to see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep on saying

36,Zona Nyaman,Pop,"[Verse 1]
Pagi ke pagi ku terjebak di dalam ambisi
Seperti orang-orang berdasi yang gila materi
Rasa bosan membukakan jalan mencari peran
Keluarlah dari zona nyaman

[Chorus]
Sembilu yang dulu
Biarlah berlalu
Bekerja bersama hati
Kita ini insan bukan seekor sapi

Sembilu yang dulu
Biarlah membiru
Berkarya bersama hati

[Verse 2]
Waktu ke waktu perlahan kurakit egoku
Merangkul orang-orang yang mulai sejiwa denganku
Ke-BM-an membukakan jalan mencari teman
Bergeraklah dari zona nyaman

[Chorus]
Sembilu yang dulu
Biarlah berlalu
Bekerja bersama hati
Kita ini insan bukan seekor sapi

Sembilu yang dulu
Biarlah membiru
Berkarya bersama hati

[Interlude]
Diam dan mati
Milik dia yang tak bisa berdiri, berdiri
Diam dan mati
Milik dia yang tak bisa berdiri
Berdiri di kakinya sendiri

[Chorus]
Sembilu yang dulu
Biarlah berlalu
Bekerja bersama hati
Kita ini insan bukan seekor sapi

Sembilu yang dulu
Biarlah membiru
Berkarya bersama hati

[Outro]
Tanamkan pesanku
Agar tak keliru
Bekerja bersama hati"

Pick up the phone, show me it was real
Pick up the phone, show me it was real
Pick up the phone, show me it was real
Pick up the phone

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, I don't wanna put no pressure on ya
I just wanna put a blessing on ya
Since our last undressin' session
I'm not really sure if you've been checkin'
I'm progressin', I just heard my songs
Is poppin' out in Macedonia
And even Serbia, I don't mean to burden ya
If you got a man since then, I understand
Last thing I wanna do is get you jammed
'Specially if he's a fan
He'll prolly never wanna hear my shit again
And I need every single SoundScan
But if you single and you down, then...
I'm in your town fiendin' for another round
I was countin' down the days
Been more patient than a Browns fan
Where that chip at?
Prolly on your shoulder, 'cause I forgot to hit back
Left you on read, apologies are said
But often never meant, well fuck that, I repent
For message never sent, now...

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Hello, stranger
It's been a minute since we last kicked it
And by the way, just got in town
And I won't let cumulus clouds all in the sky ruin my vibe
Usually, I don't do this often
But since recruiting isn't an option
Due to unusual rain and thunder
Baby, I wonder, baby, I wonder, would you just

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Put your sweats on, put your sweats on for me, yeah
'Cause I got the plug, I made the call for green
I'm talkin' late-night for you
Let me lay a great time on you
Don't hesitate, no, don't you, no, no

[Chorus: Miguel]
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Mmm say it

Hello, stranger, vape's been waiting
And just as I recall, that ass is still amazing
I'm playin', baby; nah I'm sayin', baby
Lovin' shit, you know I'm crazy
So go ahead and pour the drink up
I'm so glad we got to link up, uh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Get to takin' that off, takin' that off for me, yeah yeah
'Cause I got the plug, I made the call for green
I'm talkin' late-night for you
Let me lay a great time on you
Don't make me wait, no, don't you, no, no

[Chorus: Miguel & J. Cole]
Just say you will, will, will  yeah
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just say you will, will, will
She hit back, shit that's a good sign... yeah
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Ayy, Gucc, can I tell her some real shit? Yeah

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
In case my lack of reply had you catchin' them feelings
Know you've been on my mind like Kaepernick kneelin'
Or police killings, or Trump sayin' slick shit
Manipulatin' poor white folks because they ignant
Blind to the struggles of the ones that got the pigment
Lately I've been stressin' 'cause it seems so malignant
I need to feel your essence in my presence if you're with it
I guarantee you won't regret you did it if you come through

[Chorus: Miguel]
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just say you will, will, will
Come through and chill, chill, chill
Just say you will, will, will
I wanna f... all night (say it)
I wanna f... all night (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Come through and chill, chill, chill
I wanna f... all night (say it)
I wanna f... all night
Just say you will, will, will
I wanna f... all night (say it)
I wanna f... all night (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Come through and chill, chill, chill

Said he tried to phone me, but I never have time
He said that I never listen, but I don't even try
I got a new place in Cali, but I'm gone every night
So I fill it with strangers so they keep on the lights
She said she told you she knows me, but the face isn't right
She asked if I recognized her and I told her I might

[Pre-Chorus]
See, everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it
But I'm still alone in my mind, yeah

I know you're dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You'll wish that you never did
(You'll wish that you never did)

[Verse 2]
I stayed a night out in Paris where they don't know my name
And I got into some trouble with that drink in my veins
I got a problem with parties 'cause it's loud in my brain
And I can never say sorry 'cause I won't take the blame
I know I always go missing and you're lying awake
But if you ask why I'm distant, oh, I'm running away

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it
But I'm still alone in my mind

I know you're dying to meet me

39,Never Enough,Pop,"[Jenny Lind]
I'm trying to hold my breath
Let it stay this way
Can't let this moment end
You set off a dream with me
Getting louder now
Can you hear it echoing?
Take my hand
Will you share this with me?
'Cause darling without you

All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the nightsky
Will never be enough
Never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but it'll
Never be enough
Never be enough

For me
Never, never
Never, never
Never, for me
For me
Never enough
Never enough
Never enough

40,Shape of You,Pop,"[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

[Verse 2: SZA]
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin', I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no off switch
And the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I, I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we were runnin' out of time

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & SZA]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?

[Verse 1]
Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

[Chorus]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hopin'
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love to come around

[Verse 2]
We are one of a kind, irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical?
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated

[Chorus]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hopin'
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love
Waiting for love to come around
Co-co-come around"

Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah

Taking down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah

Setiap apa yang kita impikan
Tak semua menjadi kenyataan
Hiduplah dalam kebenaran
Kenyataan akan lebih jujur dari penantian

[Verse 1]
Apakah kau cuba untuk menafikan
Keikhlasan hatiku padamu
Betapa ku mencuba
Mendapatkan secebis kasih mu

[Verse 2]
Apakah kau tak mampu untuk menentukan
Di antara kaca dan permata
Betapa telahan mu
Memaksa ku mengundurkan diri

[Chorus]
Dan tak seharusnya aku
Bertemu dirimu di dunia ini
Dan kau membuang diriku sesuka hati mu
Dan memilih dia
Dan ku tersandar begini
Meratapi hati yang telah dilukai
Aku sedar betapa hinanya
Ku di matamu

[Bridge]
Namun jika ku diperlukan, dan diterima
Izinkan ku menagih kasihmu
Namun jika ku ditolak, tak diperlukan
Buang segala tentang ku

[Chorus]
Dan tak seharusnya aku
Bertemu dirimu di dunia ini
Dan kau membuang diriku sesuka hatimu
Dan memilih dia
Dan ku tersandar begini
Meratapi hati yang telah dilukai
Aku sedar betapa hinanya
Ku di matamu"

Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

Life's a gameÔªø made for everyone
And love is the prize

Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes

They've finally come true

There in the bars
And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
It's love
Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else
A rush
A glance
A touch
A dance

A look in somebody's eyes
To light up the skies
To open the world and send it reeling
A voice that says, I'll be here
And you'll be alright

Just where I will go
'Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling
A rat-tat-tat on my heart

Hope you're steady healing

Love and death are quite similar
How they come and go like cat burglars
Reality is kinda hard to face
Like actual facts is for flat-earthers
Rain's a requirement for flowers to grow
And pain's a requirement for power to grow
It's a miracle how one can change
From one what was just hours ago
Such is life though, it's just a cycle
The bigger picture and the smaller picture
Are exactly the same, it's macro, micro
Crack your atom and let your light glow
One day, you could be the king of pop
And the next one just be ""Wacko"" Michael
It's human nature, just like he told us
Let's face reality, crack the cycle

[Verse 4: Poo Bear]
Know it hurts to see the truth in your face
Circumstances bring you down to your knees
Go on and cry an ocean, but don't drown in it
Enough to put your heart at ease
Oh, don't lose your self esteem
I apologize, for being a man
It's way harder than what it seems

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Poo Bear]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh (reality)
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh (you might get mad at me, but I'll be at your bedside)
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Sometimes it's hard to face reality"

66,You Are My Sunshine,Pop,"The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me and love another
You'll regret it all some day:

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

You told me once, dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between
But now you've left me and love another;
You have shattered all of my dreams:

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me
When I awake my poor heart pains
So when you come back and make me happy
I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away"
67,Too Good at Goodbyes,Pop,"[Verse 1]
You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

[Chorus]
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry
(No way that you'll see me cry)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Verse 2]
I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I'm just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul

[Refrain]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes

I won't tell

[Verse 2]
My random access memory wants you to come again
No, don't say goodbye (don't say goodbye)
I saw my therapist she thinks you are my magic sin
Oh, maybe she's right (maybe she's right)
Well I'll just lick an angel just to purify again
Ooh, angels are fun (they're so fun)
So dress me up I'll like it better if we both pretend
Yeah, make love 'till we're numb

Take a byte (just take a byte)
Help yourself (just go ahead and help yourself)

Pynk, like the inside of your... baby

Pynk as we all go insane

Sunny, money, keep it funky
Touch your top and let it down

Owwww! Somethin' like that
Yeah, somethin' like that
'Cause boy, it's cool if you got blue
We got the pynk

Pynk, like the lips around you... maybe
Pynk, like the skin that's under... baby
Pynk, where it's deepest inside... crazy
Pynk beyond forest and thighs
Pynk, like the secrets you hide... maybe
Pynk, like the lid of your eye... baby
Pynk is where all of it starts... crazy
Pynk, like the holes of your heart

71,The Nights,Pop,"[Verse 1]
Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Make memories we knew would never fade

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid

[Chorus]
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me

[Verse 2]
When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars
He said go venture far beyond these shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
When I was just a kid, I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid

[Chorus]
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me

[Outro]
These are the night that never die
My father told me
Hey, hey"

You told us we hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness

[Verse 1]
Young, black, wild and free
Naked on a limousine (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Riding through the hood real slow
I love it when we smell the trees (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I just wanna party hard
Sex in the swimming pool (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I don't need a lof of cash
I just wanna break the rules (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We don't need another ruler
All of my friends are kings (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I'm not American's nightmare
I'm the American dream (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Just let me live my life

[Chorus]
I want a crazy, classic, life
I want a crazy, classic, life
So if the world should end tonight
I had a crazy, classic, life

[Verse 2]
I don't need a diamond ring
I don't wanna waste my youth
I don't wanna live on my knees
I just have to tell the truth, baby
I don't wanna be left out
I don't wanna cheat on you
I just wanna find the guy
And I hope she loves me too

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We don't need another ruler
We don't need another fool (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I'm not American's nightmare
I'm the American cool (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Just let me live my life

[Chorus]
I want a crazy, classic, life
I want a crazy, classic, life
So if the world should end tonight
I had a crazy, classic, life

I want a crazy, classic, life
I want a crazy, classic, life
So if the world should end tonight
I had a crazy, classic, life
Crazy, classic, life

[Outro]
Handcuffed in a bando
White boy in his sandals
Police like a Rambo
Blow it out, blow it out like a candle, Sambo
Me and you was friends, but to them, we the opposite
The same mistake, I'm in jail, you on top of shit
You living life while I'm walking around moppin' shit
Tech kid, backpack, no, you a college kid
All I wanted was to break the rules like you
All I wanted was someone to love me too
But no matter where it was I always stood out
Black Waldo dancing with the thick brows
We was both running naked at the luau
We was both on shrooms praying face down, waist down
Remember when they told you I was too black for ya?
And now my black poppin' like a bra-strap on ya
I was kicked out, said I'm too loud
Kicked out, said I'm too proud
But all I really ever felt was stressed out
Kinda like my afro when it's pressed out"

[You are] alone, all alone in the bedroom
Search, search for my warmth, uoh-oh, no-no
You want a remedy for your pain
Nobody can feel you better than me, uoh-oh, no-no

[Pre-Chorus: Natti Natasha, Becky G]
So that your arousal won't go away
You know that I won't leave you stuck there
Calm down, I'm on my way, my love
Calm down, I want to be with you

[Chorus: Natti Natasha, Becky G]
If you call me
We'll go to your house
We'll stay in bed
Without pajamas, without pajamas

If you call me
We'll go to your house
We'll stay in bed
Without pajamas, without pajamas (yo, yo, yo)

[Vers 1: Becky G]
I'm going to tell my secrets to your pillow
Until then let's make a video call
Send me photos, little pics
Showing everything, everything at all
When I get there, we will mess up the bed

[Bridge: Becky G]
Baby, today we're not going to sleep (no)
Baby, today we're not going to sleep (uh-uh-uh)
I did not bring pajamas
Because I did not feel like it
Baby, today we're not going to sleep

Baby, today we're not going to sleep (no)

I did not bring pajamas
Because I did not feel like it
Baby, today we're not going to sleep

Without pajamas, without pajamas

If you call me
We'll go to your house

Without pajamas, without pajamas

[Vers 2: Natti Natasha]
Since this is not a theater, stop with the drama
Light the flame in me
The way I came to the world - that's my best pajama
Today there is a curfew
I'll be yours until morning
We get romantic
Without an autopilot
Let's ditch the rules, we're tripping on cannabis
I have always been a lady (a girl)
But I'm a bitch in bed

[Bridge: Natti Natasha, Becky G]
So come on on on on on on
Add some meat to what I've got cooking
Smash it all against my bonbon, bon-bon-bon
Let's lose control, that way both of us win

So come on on on on on on
Add some fire to what I've got cooking
Smash it all against my bonbon, bon-bon-bon
I wait for your call, come score a goal on me!

[Chorus: Natti Natasha, Becky G]
If you call me
We'll go to your house
We'll stay in bed
Without pajamas, without pajamas

If you call me
We'll go to your house
We'll smoke weed
Without pajamas, without pajamas

First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look to me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Verse 2]
Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flame
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer

78,Without You,Pop,"[Verse 1]
You said that we would always be
Without you I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness you'd hide with me
Like the wind we'd be wild and free

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna to tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

[Verse 2]
Now I'm running away, my dear
From myself and the truth I fear
My heart is beating I can't see clear
How I'm wishing that you were here

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna to tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you"
79,Sunflower,Pop,"[Intro]
I want to know
Where I can go
When you're not around
And I'm feeling down
So won't you stay for a moment
So I can say
I, I need you so
Cause right now you know, that nothing here's new
And I'm obsessed with you
Then I fell to the ground
And you smiled at me and said

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna see you cry
You don't have to feel this emptiness
She said I love you till the day that I die
Well maybe she's right
Cause I don't wanna feel like I'm not me
And to be honest I don't even know why
I let myself get down in the first place

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflowers still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down, do-do-down
Diggy dig down, du du du du
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes

[Verse 2]
You know you need to get yourself to sleep and dream
A dream of you and I
There's no need to keep an open eye
I promise I'm the one for you
Just let me hold you in these arms tonight
I‚Äôm lucky to be me and you can see it in my face
Back when I fucked my shit up too many times
Why would I let myself get down in the first place

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflowers still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down, do-do-down
Diggy dig down, du du du
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes

[Bridge]
And so she sat me down and told me that I didn't have to cry
Said I didn't need to get down and feel empty inside
And told me that she love me for as long as she's alive
And well, maybe she's right, cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me
See, I honestly, don't even know why
I, I honestly don't even know why

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflowers still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down, do-do-down
Diggy dig down, du du du
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes"
80,BEGIN,Pop,"[Verse 1]
When I was fifteen years old, I had nothing
The world was too big and I was small
Now I can‚Äôt even imagine now
I was scentless and completely empty
I pray

Love you my brother, I‚Äôve got brothers
I discovered emotions, I became me
So I‚Äôm me
Now I‚Äôm me

You make me begin
You make me begin

I can‚Äôt take it anymore
Because you are crying
I want to cry in your place
Although I can‚Äôt

(Cry with me, cry with me
Cry with me)
You make me begin

I feel like dying
When my brother is sad
When my brother is sick
It hurts more than when I‚Äôm sick

[Verse 5]
Brother let‚Äôs cry, cry, cry and get it over with
I don‚Äôt know much about sadness
But I‚Äôm gonna cry anyway
Because, because

82,The Other Side,Pop,"[Verse 1: P.T. Barnum]
Right here, right now
I put the offer out
I don't want to chase you down
I know you see it
You run with me
And I can cut you free
Out of the drudgery and walls you keep in
So trade that typical for something colorful
And if it's crazy, live a little crazy
You can play it sensible, a king of conventional
Or you can risk it all and see

[Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
Don't you wanna get away from the same old part you gotta play
'Cause I got what you need
So come with me and take the ride
It'll take you to the other side
'Cause you can do like you do
Or you can do like me
Stay in the cage, or you'll finally take the key
Oh, damn! Suddenly you're free to fly
It'll take you to the other side

[Verse 2: Phillip Carlyle]
Okay, my friend, you want to cut me in
Well I hate to tell you, but it just won't happen
So thanks, but no
I think I'm good to go
'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in
Now I admire you, and that whole show you do
You're onto something, really it's something
But I live among the swells, and we don't pick up peanut shells
I'll have to leave that up to you

[Chorus: Phillip Carlyle]
Don't you know that I'm okay with this uptown part I get to play
'Cause I got what I need and I don't want to take the ride
I don't need to see the other side
So go and do like you do
I'm good to do like me
Ain't in a cage, so I don't need to take the key
Oh, damn! Can't you see I'm doing fine
I don't need to see the other side

[Verse 3: P.T. Barnum]
Now is this really how you like to spend your days?
Whiskey and misery, and parties and plays

[Phillip Carlyle]
If I were mixed up with you, I'd be the talk of the town
Disgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns

[P.T. Barnum]
But you would finally live a little, finally laugh a little
Just let me give you the freedom to dream and it'll
Wake you up and cure your aching
Take your walls and start 'em breaking
Now that's a deal that seems worth taking
But I guess I'll leave that up to you

[Bridge: Phillip Carlyle]
Well it's intriguing, but to go would cost me greatly
So what percentage of the show would I be taking?

[P.T. Barnum]
Fair enough, you'd want a piece of all the action
I'd give you seven, we could shake and make it happen

[Phillip Carlyle]
I wasn't born this morning, eighteen would be just fine

[P.T. Barnum]
Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime

[Phillip Carlyle]
Fifteen

[P.T. Barnum]
I'd do eight

[Phillip Carlyle]
Twelve

[P.T. Barnum]
Maybe nine

[Phillip Carlyle]
Ten

[Chorus: Both]
Don't you wanna get away to a whole new part you're gonna play
'Cause I got what you need, so come with me and take the ride
To the other side
So if you do like I do
So if you do like me
Forget the cage, 'cause we know how to make the key
Oh, damn! Suddenly we're free to fly
We're going to the other side
So if you do like I do
(To the other side)
So if you do like me
(We're going to the other side)
'Cause if we do we're going to the other side
We're going to the other side"

I'm not that special

Crashing slowly, the bugs are in me

Picking my face up off the ground

I think I, I think I finally
Found a way to forgive myself
From mistakes I made in my past
I think that's the first step, right?
You agree?

[Verse]
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts, break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leavin' you in fear
Oh man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then, oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts, break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot

In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
I'll rot, I'll rot, I'll rot
Is my pain your freedom?
Is all of my pain your freedom?

86,Billie Jean,Pop,"[1st Verse]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

[2nd Verse]
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Bridge]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts""
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth""

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

[3rd Verse]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (hoo)

[4th Verse]
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (oh no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

[Bridge]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts""
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
She says she is the one
She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover"

[Verse 1]
I‚Äôm living in that 21st Century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock‚Äôs ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I‚Äôm tripping off the power
(21st-Century schizoid man)
The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open
We ain‚Äôt got nothing to lose, motherfucker we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I‚Äôll see you in the morning
Huh? I‚Äôll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

[Hook]
No one man should have all that power
The clock‚Äôs ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I‚Äôm tripping off the power
Till then, fuck that, the world‚Äôs ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say

[Verse 2]
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my asshole
I‚Äôm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he‚Äôs so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn‚Äôt open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I‚Äôm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinking

[Hook]
No one man should have all that power
The clock‚Äôs ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I‚Äôm tripping off the powder
Till then, fuck that, the world‚Äôs ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say

[Verse 3]
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama‚Äôs nation
Well that‚Äôs a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, god damn it I‚Äôm killing this shit
I know damn well y‚Äôall feeling this shit
I don‚Äôt need your pussy, bitch, I‚Äôm on my own dick
I ain‚Äôt gotta power trip, who you going home with?
How 'Ye doing? I‚Äôm surviving
I was drinking earlier, now I‚Äôm driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding?
I got the power to make your life so exciting

Now this will be a beautiful death
I‚Äôm jumping out the window, I‚Äôm letting everything go
I‚Äôm letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
I‚Äôm jumping out the window, I‚Äôm letting everything go
I‚Äôm letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
I‚Äôm jumping out the window, I‚Äôm letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

Hope life is beautiful
You were the light for me to find my truth
I just wanna say, thank you

Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty
When our hearts get broke
Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold
Oh, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Cigarettes in the ashtray
Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you‚Äôd end up with my last name
But that changed
And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while
I start texting
Write a paragraph
But then I delete the message
Think 'bout you like a past time
I could cry you a river
Get you baptised or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study Art
Love is just a tool
To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone
And we're walking in the dark

[Chorus: Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen]
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and

She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes

95,Sky Full of Song,Pop,"[Verse 1]
How deeply are you sleeping or are you still awake?
A good friend told me you've been staying out so late
Be careful, oh, my darling, oh, be careful what it takes
From what I've seen so far, the good ones always seem to break
And I was screaming at my father and you were screaming at me
And I can feel your anger from way across the sea
And I was kissing strangers, I was causing such a scene
Oh, the heart it hides such unimaginable things

[Pre-Chorus]
Grab me by my ankles, I've been flying for too long
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song
And I want you so badly, but you could be anyone
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song

[Chorus]
Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie

[Verse 2]
And I can tell that I'm in trouble when that music starts to play
In a city without seasons, it keeps raining in LA
I feel like I'm about to fall, the room begins to sway
And I can hear the sirens but I cannot walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
Grab me by my ankles, I've been flying for too long
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song
And I want you so badly, but you could be anyone
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song

[Chorus]
Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie

[Bridge]
I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight
I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight
And I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight
And I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight

[Chorus]
Hold me down, I'm so tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky (shoot, shoot, shoot)
Take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie  (Fire)

Hold me down, I'm too tired now
Aim your arrow at the sky (shoot, shoot, shoot)
And take me down, I'm too tired now
Leave me where I lie  (Fire)"

Breakin' us down and wearin' us thin
But I love you still, I always will

Wanna stay, can you give me a reason?
I don't think so, I don't think so
I'm in love with someone, but I'm not sure
She can love someone back the way they love her
I don't think so, I don't think so

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't be mean, if you wanna go
You can leave and leave my heart alone

[Chorus]
Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it

[Verse 2]
Give it time, c'mon babe, it's been ten months
You should know, do you know, know what you want?
I don't think so, I don't think so
Make it work, know it hurts, but I'll go there
Do the same, can you show me that you care?
God, I hope so, but I don't think so

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't be mean, if you're here for good
I'm gonna need a little more from you

Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it
All my friends keep saying that I'm way too good to you
But my heart is so invested, I don't wanna face the truth
I'm not happy, and you know it, and you still don't even try
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it

[Chorus]
Waking up to nothing when you're super far from home
And I watch you fall asleep at night and lay there on my own
Got me begging for affection, all you do is roll your eyes
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it
All my friends keep saying that I'm way too good to you

I'm not happy, and you know it, and you still don't even try
Broken down, I've had enough
If this is love, I don't want it"
102,River,Pop,"[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run"

I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them
I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine

Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive?
She said

‚ÄúBe careful with that one, love
He will do what it takes to survive.‚Äù

You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
You built cathedrals
I‚Äôm re-reading the letters you wrote me
I‚Äôm searching and scanning for answers
In every line
For some kind of sign
And when you were mine
The world seemed to

Burn
Burn

You published the letters she wrote you
You told the whole world how you brought
This girl into our bed
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you‚Äôd done?
She said
‚ÄúYou have married an Icarus
He has flown too close to the sun.‚Äù

You and your words, obsessed with your legacy...
Your sentences border on senseless
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you

You, you, you‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder how Eliza
Reacted when you broke her heart
You have torn it all apart
I am watching it
Burn
Watching it burn
The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed
They don‚Äôt get to know what I said
I‚Äôm burning the memories
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed
You sleep in your office instead
With only the memories
Of when you were mine
I hope that you burn"

Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you

You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt yet
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?

What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you

Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Could have made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

Got me questioning what I think is important
I can't even lie, think of you when I'm with her

Haven't seen you in a year, but I still get you
Hurts to see you laugh 'cause I know I'll fucking miss that

Times that we have, so wild, can't forget that

Hope you know you fire, fuck anyone who doubts you
Life out in Cali has been great, I'm committed
You the only thing that makes me wish things were different

Sei la mia donna

Cogli i miei sogni e i miei segreti molto di pi√π

Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go‚Äã nowhere fast
Let's enjoy right here where we at

Who knows where this road is supposed to lead?
We got nothing, but time
As long as you're right here next to me, everything's gonna be alright

If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be

See, where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha]
I don't mean to be so uptight
But my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gon' lie, ain't gon' lie
'Cause I'm tired of the fake love
Show me, what you're made of
Boy, make me believe

[Pre-Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
Oh hold up, girl, don't you know you're beautiful?
And it's easy to see

Maybe we do
Maybe we don't

Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you

Just think of the fun things we could do

Handsome, you're a mansion with a view

Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

To the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete

Listen
To the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release

Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believin' you
You don't what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
And now I've gotta find my own

You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

Oh, I'm screamin' out and my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worse
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't

Listen
To the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete

Oh, now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'

I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own

The price of my love‚Äôs not a price that you‚Äôre willing to pay

In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you‚Äôre making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I‚Äôm your man
You‚Äôll be back, soon you‚Äôll see
You‚Äôll remember you belong to me
You‚Äôll be back, time will tell
You‚Äôll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise, empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love!

So your best friend screwed you over
Acted nice when she‚Äôs not nice
Well, I have some advice
‚ÄòCause it‚Äôs happened to me. Twice
Here‚Äôs my secret strategy
It always works because
The world doesn‚Äôt end
It just feels like it does

So raise your right finger
And solemnly swear
""Whatever they say about me
I don‚Äôt care!""

I won‚Äôt twist in knots to join your game
I will say, ""you make me mad.""
And if you treat me bad
I‚Äôll say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre bad‚Äù

And if I eat alone from this moment on
That‚Äôs just what I‚Äôll do
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôd rather be me, I‚Äôd rather be me
I‚Äôd rather be me than be with you

We‚Äôre supposed to all be ladies
And be nurturing and care
Is that really fair?
Boys get to fight, we have to share
Here‚Äôs the way that turns out
We always understand
How to slap someone down
With our underhand

So here‚Äôs my right finger
To how girls should behave
'Cause sometimes what‚Äôs meant to break you
Makes you brave

So I will not act all innocent
I won‚Äôt fake apologize
Let‚Äôs just fight and then make up
Not tell these lies

Let‚Äôs call our damage even
Clean the slate till it's like new
It‚Äôs a new life for me
Where I‚Äôd rather be me
I‚Äôd rather be me
Than be with you

[JANIS]
I'll say, ""NO!""

[FEMALE STUDENTS]
NO!

[JANIS]
I‚Äôll say, ""knock it off, with your notes and your rules and your games.""
And those sycophants who follow you
I‚Äôll remember all their names

And when they drag you down
Like they inevitably do
I will not laugh along with them and approve their palace coup, ‚Äòcause that‚Äôs not me

Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system; a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes"

135,From Now On,Pop,"[Verse 1: P.T. Barnum]
I saw the sun begin to dim
And felt that winter wind
Blow cold
A man learns who is there for him
When the glitter fades and the walls won't hold
'Cause from then, rubble
What remains
Can only be what's true
If all was lost
There's more I gained
'Cause it led me back
To you

[Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
From now on
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights
From now on
What's waited till tomorrow starts tonight
Tonight
Let this promise in me start
Like an anthem in my heart
From now on
From now on

[Verse 2: P.T. Barnum]
I drank champagne with kings and queens
The politicians praised my name
But those are someone else's dreams
The pitfalls of the man I became
For years and years
I chased their cheers
The crazy speed of always needing more
But when I stop
And see you here
I remember who all this was for

[Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
And from now on
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights
From now on
What's waited till tomorrow starts tonight
It starts tonight
And let this promise in me start

136,Us,Pop,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm beaten
Sometimes I'm broke
‚ÄòCause sometimes this city is nothing but smoke
Is there a secret?
Is there a code?
Can we make it better?
'Cause I'm losing hope

[Chorus]
Tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us

[Verse 2]
After the wreckage
After the dust
I still hear the howling, I still feel the rush
Over the riots, above all the noise
Through all the worry, I still hear your voice

[Chorus]
So, tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how ‚Äòcause I believe in something
I believe in us
Tell me when the light goes down
That even in the dark we will find a way out
Tell me now 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us

[Bridge]
We used to be kids living just for kicks
In cinema seats, learning how to kiss
Running through streets that were painted gold
We never believed we'd grow up like this

[Chorus]
So tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us
Tell me when the light goes down
That even in the dark we can find a way out
Tell me now 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us
I believe in something
And I believe in us"
137,Bohemian Rhapsody,Pop,"[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh, (any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo. Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go.) Will not let you go
(Let me go.) Will not let you go. (Let me go.) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

138,Pray (Remix),Pop,"[Verse 1: Logic]
They never knew my struggle
Rose above the rubble
Rather live inside they bubble
Than go through the trouble
Of having they double-double vision corrected
They just neglect it and‚Äî
I've been thinkin' lately
Will the Devil take me?
Or will God protect me?
I know I ain't perfect, but you should respect me
They don't want me happy
They don't want to let me live

[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
I'm young and I'm foolish, I made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat na√Øve
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray

[Verse 3: Logic]
I am me
I'm a man, I'm a sinner
But understand, aren't we all?
So when it comes to passin' judgements
I don't think that you're the one to make the call
Heaven want to cast me out for being me
I know there's others like me that'll break the fall
I know you hater motherfuckers just can't relate at all
If I'm the first one to the line, that's fine, I'll take it all
Well Logic, He gon' let 'em know
I ain't perfect, but I'm worth it
I'm alive, I deserve it
I been praying, I ain't playin'
I don't think you hear the words that I'm sayin'
I don't think you know the weight on my shoulders
That gets heavier as I get older
Callin' anybody, callin' anybody
""Can you hear me?""
I pray that you hear me
I pray that you hear me

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Maybe I'll pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna...

[Bridge: Sam Smith]
Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end
Oh, won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end

[Outro: Sam Smith]
Oh, I'm gonna pray
I'm gonna pray
I'm gonna pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you
No, but I'm gonna pray"

140,Say You Won't Let Go,Pop,"[Verse 1]
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Bridge]
I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"
141,We Are Young,Pop,"[Verse 1: Nate Ruess]
Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things, the holes in my apologies
You know I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

Cause I found someone to carry me home

Like you could fall, and no one would hear?

That was the gift he gave me, to show me that I wasn't alone
To show me that I mattered Everybody does

That life just doesn't begin
Until you're

If I don't stand out one bit

I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

[Verse 2: David Paich]
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa

148,Your Reality,Pop,"[Verse 1]
Every day, I imagine a future where I can be with you
In my hand is a pen that will write a poem of me and you
The ink flows down into a dark puddle
Just move your hand - write the way into his heart!
But in this world of infinite choices
What will it take just to find that special day?
What will it take just to find that special day?

[Verse 2]
Have I found everybody a fun assignment to do today?
When you're here, everything that we do is fun for them anyway
When I can't even read my own feelings
What good are words when a smile says it all?
And if this world won't write me an ending
What will it take just for me to have it all?

[Verse 3]
Does my pen only write bitter words for those who are dear to me?
Is it love if I take you, or is it love if I set you free?
The ink flows down into a dark puddle
How can I write love into reality?
If I can't hear the sound of your heartbeat
What do you call love in your reality?
And in your reality, if I don't know how to love you
I'll leave you be"
149,Love Yourself,Pop,"[Produced by Benny Blanco]

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself"

151,Myself,Pop,"[Verse 1]
I think I'm losing my mind
Trying to stay inside the lines
It's like I'm running in place
How you keep staying the same?
Baby, I, I guess I'm something different
And I'm okay with that
I can't fake no more smiles
That shit gon' drive me mad
I'm focused on the future
Don't care 'bout nothin' else

[Chorus]
I'm better by myself
I'm better by myself
I don't need no one else
I'm better by myself
Myself

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna answer questions
Just want your company
It's all good on the surface
Show me what's underneath
I'm not concerned with drama
I left that shit in school
I'm more concerned with commas
Than keeping up with you
Keep that away from me
I put the Heisman up to bad energy
No empathy, especially when the kid off Hennessy
Fake friends to me make my mood go south like Tennessee
Make the fool come out like, ""Who is he?""
I mean, I'm trying to tell y'all

[Chorus]
I'm better by myself
I'm better by myself
I don't need no one else
I'm better by myself
Myself

[Outro]
I don't know who to trust
These days everyone's shady
Fool me once, I'm on my own
There is no second time, baby
That's the shit I don't like
Please no yes, no maybes
What else?"

Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Look, I didn't power through the struggle
Just to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witnessed, after all of these decisions
All these miles, feet, inches
They can't add up to the distance
That I have been through, just to get to
A place where even if there's no closure, I'm still safe
I still ache from trying to keep pace
Somebody give me a sign, I'm starting to lose faith

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Harris & Machine Gun Kelly]
Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair
I'm trying to find

[Chorus: Sam Harris + Bebe Rexha & Machine Gun Kelly]
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
It's been a long time coming
Someone take me

Home, ho-o-o-o-me
Home, home
Someone take me
Home, ho-o-o-o-me
Home, home

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Look, I've been through so much pain
And it's hard to maintain, any smile on my face
'Cause there's madness on my brain
So I gotta make it back, but my home ain't on the map
Gotta follow what I'm feeling to discover where it's at
I need the (memory)
In case this fate is forever, just to be sure these last days are better
And if I have any (enemies)
To give me the strength to look the devil in the face and make it home safe

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Harris & Machine Gun Kelly]
Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair
I'm trying to find

[Chorus: Sam Harris + Bebe Rexha]
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me

[Bridge: Bebe Rexha + Sam Harris]
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone

[Post-Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly, Sam Harris & Bebe Rexha]
Someone take me
Home, ho-o-o-o-me
Take me home
Home, home (take me home)
Someone take me

Nothing here feels like home

You stumble through your days
Got your head hung low
Your skies' a shade of grey
Like a zombie in a maze
You're asleep inside
But you can shake awake

[Pre-Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
'Cause you're just a dead man walking
Thinking that's your only option
But you can flip the switch and brighten up your darkest day
Sun is up and the color's blinding
Take the world and redefine it
Leave behind your narrow mind
You'll never be the same

[Pre-Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
Come alive, come alive
Go and light your light
Let it burn so bright
Reaching up
To the sky
And it's open wide
You're electrified

[Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And you know you can't go back again
To the world that you were living in
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
So, come alive!

[Verse 2: P.T. Barnum]
I see it in your eyes
You believe that lie
That you need to hide your face
Afraid to step outside
So you lock the door
But don't you stay that way

[Lettie Lutz]
No more living in those shadows
You and me, we know how that goes

[Lord of Leeds]
'Cause once you see it, oh you'll never, never be the same

[Both]
We will be the light that's turning
Bottle up but keep on shining

[All]
You can prove there's more to you

[P.T. Barnum]
You cannot be afraid

[Pre-Chorus: Ensemble]
Come alive, come alive
Go and light your light
Let it burn so bright
Reaching up
To the sky
And it's open wide
You're electrified

[Chorus: Ensemble]
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't be go back again
To the world that we were living in
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open
So, come alive!

[Ensemble]
Come one!
Come all!
Come in!
Come on!

[Anne Wheeler]
To anyone who's bursting with a dream

[Ensemble]
Come one!
Come all!
You hear
The call

[P.T. Barnum]
To anyone who's searching for a way to break free

[Ensemble]
Break free!
Break free!

[Chorus: Ensemble and P.T. Barnum]
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't be go back again
To the world that we were living in
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open
(Hey!)

[Chorus: Ensemble and P.T. Barnum]
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't be go back again
To the world that we were living in
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open

[Outro: Ensemble and P.T. Barnum]
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open

So come alive! (Come alive!)"
158,See You Again,Pop,"[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place, uh

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah"

It could change, but this feels like, like the calm before the storm
Not that I don't wanna try, but I've been here before
Friends in town, phone's at home, I tell myself it's fine
Can't remember how you taste, slept alone too many nights

[Chorus]
Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?
Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?

[Verse 2]
Half my clothes are at your house, and I don't want them back
The smell of you is way too much, not gonna put my heart through that
I don't know how much time we got, I don't know how much to say
I don't know, tell me what you want, I want you to want me to stay

Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright

[Verse 1]
The truth is I'm high your love is feelings
And I don't know what to do
Do I hold my breath as I wait for you?
Can I afford to compromise
These feelings and save my mind?
I feel my head rush as I think of you
And try to put myself to use
Left there in time don't always heal the wounds
It's crazy it must be love

Should I hold on the past?
Will you let me crash?
Should I hold on the past?

And we will collide

164,Take Me to Church,Pop,"[Produced by Hozier and Rob Kirwan]

[Video directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson]

[Verse 1: Hozier]
My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me ""worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus: Hozier]
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus: Hozier]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Chorus: Hozier]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 2: Hozier]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus: Hozier]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Chorus: Hozier]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Bridge: Hozier]
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus: Hozier]
Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus: Hozier]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Chorus: Hozier]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid

I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you

Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late, and he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah, the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
And say, ""Your hair's on fire, you must've lost your wits"", yeah

167,Can't Hold Us,Pop,"[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking a new hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope nope, y'all can't copy
Yup, Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushin'
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give it to the people, spread it across the country

[Hook: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that‚Äôs what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Tell me go up, gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said‚Ä¶

[Hook: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Outro *Music Video Ending*]
Let the night come, before the fight's won
Some might run against the test
But those that triumph embrace the fight 'cause
The fear is there to prove that courage exists
Now let the night come, before the fight's won
And some might run against the test
But those that triumph embrace the fight 'cause
The fear is there to prove that courage exists"
168,Let Her Go,Pop,"[Produced by Mike Rosenberg and Chris Vallejo]
[Video by Dave Jensen and Tavic]

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

[Hook]
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
And you let her go
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
When you let her go
Whoa

[Hook]
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go..."

I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

[Post-Chorus 1]
The way that Gucci look on you, amazing
But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
You're saying you're the one for me, I need to face it

[Verse 1]
Started when we were younger
Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mum found out
Guess that we just really had the thunder
Ain't nobody else said I'd be under
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
No, no, no

You came a little closer, now you're shaking

'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind

I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you thinking about it, yeah
Do I gotta convince you?
That you shouldn't fall asleep
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

[Chorus]
Do you got plans tonight?

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 1]
Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'mma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

[Refrain]
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 2]
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride?
No, they used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

[Bridge]
Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

I look in the mirror, say, ""What's up?""

176,Hello,Pop,"[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Anymore

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Would you break it, if you're honest

181,Gotta Go My Own Way,Pop,"[Gabriella]
I gotta say what's on my mind
Something about us doesn't seem right these days
Life keeps getting in the way
Whenever we try, somehow the plan
Is always rearranged

It's so hard to say
But I've gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay...

I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way

Don't wanna leave it all behind
But I get my hopes up
And I watch them fall every time
Another color turns to grey
And it's just too hard to watch it all
Slowly fade away
I'm leaving today cause I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay...

I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way

[Troy]
What about us?
What about everything we've been through?

[Gabriella]
What about trust?

[Troy]
You know I never wanted to hurt you

[Gabriella]
And what about me?

[Troy]
What am I supposed to do?

[Gabriella]
I gotta leave but

[Both]
I'll miss you

[Gabriella (Troy)]
So I've got to move on and be who I am
(Why do you have to go?)
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand
(I'm trying to understand)
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
(I want you to stay)
I gotta go my own way

I've got to move on and be who I am
(What about us?)
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand
(I'm trying to understand)
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
I gotta go my own way
I gotta go my own way"
182,Hard 2 Face Reality,Pop,"[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Don't be afraid to stand alone
Don't be afraid to stand outside the door alone
I know it's hard away from home
And it ain't easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin' to your significant other all night long

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

[Verse 2: Poo Bear]
Should've been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time
Now you're standin' right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Try to protect your feelings
You read in between the lines
Hope your heart has started healing

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality"
183,Sick Boy,Pop,"[Verse 1]
I'm from the east side of America
Where we choose pride over character
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

[Refrain]
And don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say, when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Where we're united under our indifference

[Verse 2]
And I'm from the east side of America
Where we desensitize by hysteria
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, this is us, this is us, this is

[Chorus]
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
They say that I am the sick boy
And they call me the sick boy

[Refrain]
Don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say, when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Where we're united under our indifference

[Bridge]
Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?
Feed yourself on my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm from the east side of America
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I live on the west side of America
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I'm from the east side of America
They say that I am the sick boy
I live on the west side of America
Yeah, they call me the sick boy

[Chorus]
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy
They say that I am the sick boy
Yeah, they call me the sick boy"

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

[Pre-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Verse 2: Halsey]
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older

So, baby, pull me closer

That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder

188,A Thousand Years,Pop,"[Verse 1]
Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall
But watching you stand alone?
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer

[Chorus]
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

[Verse 2]
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer

[Chorus]
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

[Bridge]
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
One step closer
One step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you

I have loved you for a thousand years

194,Someone Like You,Pop,"[Verse 1]
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
""I'll remember,"" you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Verse 2]
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
""I'll remember,"" you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Bridge]
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

[Breakdown]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
""I'll remember,"" you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two

196,I Took A Pill In Ibiza,Pop,"[Verse 1]
I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Verse 2]
I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

[Chorus]
Now you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Verse 3]
I took a plane to my home town
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said tell us how to make it cause we're getting real impatient
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

[Chorus]
You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs"

Little town, it's a quiet village
Every day like the one before
Little town, full of little people
Waking up to say

[ENSEMBLE]
Bonjour! Bonjour!
Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!

[BELLE]
There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor, provincial town

[MONSIEUR JEAN, spoken]
Good Morning, Belle!

[BELLE, spoken]
Good morning, Monsieur Jean
Have you lost something again?

[MONSIEUR JEAN, spoken]
Well, I believe I have
Problem is, I've‚ÄîI can't remember what
Oh well, I'm sure it'll come to me
Where are you off to?

[BELLE]
To return this book to P√®re Robert
It's about two lovers in fair Verona

[MONSIEUR JEAN, spoken]
Sounds boring

[ENSEMBLE]
Look there she goes, that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?
Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

Bonjour! Good day! How is your family?
Bonjour! Good day! How is your wife?
I need six eggs! That's too expensive!

[BELLE]
There must be more than this provincial life!

[PERE ROBERT, spoken]
Ahh, if it isn't the only bookworm in town!
So, where did you run off to this week?

[BELLE, spoken]
Two cities in Northern Italy
I didn't want to come back
Have you got any new places to go?

[PERE ROBERT, spoken]
I'm afraid not...
But you may re-read any of the old ones that you'd like

[BELLE, spoken]
Your library makes our small corner of the world feel big

[PERE ROBERT, spoken]
Bon voyage!

[ENSEMBLE]
Look there she goes, the girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

[BELLE]
Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because‚Äîyou'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til Chapter Three!

[ENSEMBLE]
Now it's no wonder that her name means ""Beauty""
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very diff'rent from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle!

[GASTON, spoken]
Look at her, LeFou‚Äîmy future wife
Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village
That makes her the best

[LEFOU, spoken]
But she's so... well-read!
And you're so... athletically inclined

[GASTON, spoken]
Yes... But ever since the war, I've felt like I've been missing something. And she's the only girl that gives me that sense of‚Äî

[LEFOU, spoken]
Mmm... je ne sais quoi?

I don't know what that means

(sung)
Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town, there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

[ENSEMBLE]
Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute!
Be still, my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!

[WOMAN 1]
Bonjour!

[GASTON]
Pardon

[BELLE]
Good day

[WOMAN 2]
Mais oui!

[WOMAN 3]
You call this bacon?

[WOMAN 4]
What lovely flowers!

[Man 1]
Some cheese

[WOMAN 5]
Ten yards!

[MAN 1]
One pound

[GASTON]
Excuse me

[CHEESE MERCHANT]
I'll get the knife

[GASTON]
Please let me through!

[WOMAN 6]
This bread

[WOMAN 7]
Those fish

[WOMAN 6]
It's stale!

[WOMAN 7]
They smell!

[MEN]
Madame's mistaken

[WOMEN]
Well, maybe so

[BELLE]
There must be more than this provincial life!

[GASTON]
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!

[ENSEMBLE]
Look there she goes
That girl is strange but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle!

It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in
'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle!"
